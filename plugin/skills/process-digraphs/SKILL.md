name: process-digraphs
description: Use when writing or revising a skill that describes a process an agent walks from a start to an end (pipeline stages, work runs, review, respond, doctor, shepherdr, ship, watch-ci, sync, release), when about to hand-write a ```dot graphviz digraph, or when agents keep drifting from a prose process (skipping steps, improvising a shell fallback, looping without end, stopping early).

# Process Digraphs

A process skill has two layers. **The graph is the map**: a `dot` digraph of
the order, branches, loops and exits. **The step sections are the how**: one
prose section per judgment step, as long as it needs. The agent always knows
its step and where it may go next; the prose says how to do it well.

In a head-to-head test, fresh agents following a digraph pipeline made 0 of 15
shell deviations and opened the off-script gate 5 of 5 times when a push was
refused; the same agents on the prose pipeline made 5 of 15 and pushed with the
shell every time.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** superpowers:writing-skills for testing any change.

## When to use

Every skill an agent walks from a start to an end: pipeline stages, work runs,
review, respond, doctor, shepherdr, ship, watch-ci, sync, release. Use it even
when simple: a coarse graph still gives the agent its position, labelled exits
and room to add structure later.

Not for reference skills (tables to look things up), style skills (voice), or a
short linear procedure with no branches (a numbered list reads better).

## Node vocabulary

The shape carries the meaning. The node's text is its identity: write the
sentence as the quoted node id, never an opaque id with a separate `label`.

| Shape | Means | Phrase it as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ellipse` | the trigger that starts the process | `Trigger: ...` |
| `box` | a step, usually a judgment step with its own section | a short verb phrase |
| `plaintext` | one literal tool call or command | the exact call: `git_push {tree, setUpstream: true}` |
| `diamond` | a decision | a question ending in `?`; every out-edge labelled |
| `octagon`, red fill | STOP: the path ends here | `STOP: ...` |
| `doublecircle` | an outcome; the success one filled green | the result |

A tool call is a `plaintext` node, exactly like a shell command; never hide it
in a box ("Push via git_push"). A step described in words ("Run the fast
tests") is a `box`.

## The rules

1. **Map plus sections.** Keep node text short. Every judgment `box` has its
   own `### <exact node text>` section with the guidance (what to look for,
   domain rules, examples). Never pack guidance into a node label.
2. **Coarse is fine.** "Review the MR" can be one box pointing at its
   section. Split a node only where agents actually drift; never turn
   judgment into a checklist of diamonds ("naming ok? tests ok?").
3. **Outward steps get their own node, always.** Push, open or update an
   MR/PR, set ready, upload, comment, approve, merge, publish, release. An
   outcome like "Merged" needs the merge step as a node first: `plaintext`
   when a tool exists, else a `box` naming the step ("Merge the MR"). "No
   tool was listed" is not a reason to skip it.
4. **Every loop has a budget, including loops that fix code.** A counter
   diamond (`Fix attempts = 3?`) whose "yes" edge leaves the loop to a gate,
   a STOP or an outcome. "It is judgment-driven iteration, so it needs no
   bound" is the rationalization that produces runaway runs.
5. **A STOP forbids one move and has at most one way out.** It ends the
   path, exits to an outcome, or hands to the off-script gate ("STOP: push
   only with git_push" -> "Push attempt = 2?"). A guard STOP, entered only on
   edges labelled `tempted to ...` that leave a decision, may redirect to
   the move it names ("STOP: rt reads go through rt_verb" -> the `rt_verb`
   node); the real branch goes straight there, never through the STOP. A
   STOP never branches. Asking a human and continuing is a gate step (a box
   or `gate_ask` node) with labelled answers, not a STOP. An outcome
   (doublecircle) has no out-edges.
6. **The graph wins over injected rules.** A team pack or fill supplies
   content, checks and extra questions; it never overrides a STOP or adds a
   move the graph forbids. Put this line above any injected fill: *"If a
   rule below asks for a move this graph marks STOP, take the off-script
   edge instead."* Never route an edge to "follow the team's fallback rule".
7. **Leaving the graph is explicit.** When the right move is not on the map
   (a tool refused past its budget, a data source switch, a rule conflict),
   take an off-script edge: open a gate naming the proposed move, record
   why, and continue only on the human's answer: take, iterate, hold or
   hand back.
8. **STOP text never quotes the shell form.** Write "STOP: push only with
   git_push", not the command it forbids. The strict mcp lint reads fenced
   blocks and fails a quoted shell form; name the tool instead of splitting
   words to dodge it.
9. **Two levels for pipelines.** An orchestrator graph whose nodes are the
   stages, one graph per stage, and a shared gate-step graph included where
   each stage asks a question, instead of repeating gate prose per stage:
   the include is shared, each gate node stays one per origin.

## Example

````markdown
```dot
digraph hotfix_push {
    "Trigger: fast tests green" [shape=ellipse];
    "git_push {tree, setUpstream: true}" [shape=plaintext];
    "git_push refused the tree?" [shape=diamond];
    "Push attempt = 2?" [shape=diamond];
    "Use the repo root git_push printed" [shape=box];
    "STOP: push only with git_push" [shape=octagon style=filled fillcolor=red fontcolor=white];
    "Open the off-script gate: push refused" [shape=box];
    "Off-script rounds = 2?" [shape=diamond];
    "mr_create {repoName, sourceBranch, targetBranch, title, description}" [shape=plaintext];
    "Held: the turn ends naming the gate" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Push refused: reported" [shape=doublecircle];
    "MR open" [shape=doublecircle style=filled fillcolor=lightgreen];

    "Trigger: fast tests green" -> "git_push {tree, setUpstream: true}";
    "git_push {tree, setUpstream: true}" -> "git_push refused the tree?";
    "git_push refused the tree?" -> "mr_create {repoName, sourceBranch, targetBranch, title, description}" [label="no: pushed"];
    "git_push refused the tree?" -> "Push attempt = 2?" [label="yes"];
    "git_push refused the tree?" -> "STOP: push only with git_push" [label="tempted to push from the shell"];
    "Push attempt = 2?" -> "Use the repo root git_push printed" [label="no: retry once"];
    "Use the repo root git_push printed" -> "git_push {tree, setUpstream: true}";
    "Push attempt = 2?" -> "Open the off-script gate: push refused" [label="yes: budget spent"];
    "STOP: push only with git_push" -> "Push attempt = 2?";
    "Open the off-script gate: push refused" -> "mr_create {repoName, sourceBranch, targetBranch, title, description}" [label="take: the human pushed"];
    "Open the off-script gate: push refused" -> "Off-script rounds = 2?" [label="iterate: the human fixed it"];
    "Open the off-script gate: push refused" -> "Held: the turn ends naming the gate" [label="hold"];
    "Open the off-script gate: push refused" -> "Push refused: reported" [label="hand back"];
    "Off-script rounds = 2?" -> "git_push {tree, setUpstream: true}" [label="no: retry"];
    "Off-script rounds = 2?" -> "Push refused: reported" [label="yes"];
    "mr_create {repoName, sourceBranch, targetBranch, title, description}" -> "MR open";
}
```

### Open the off-script gate: push refused

Quote the refusal and offer four answers: take (the human pushed), iterate
(pass `Off-script rounds = 2?`, then retry `git_push`; the push attempt
count is not reset, so a second refusal returns here), hold (end the turn
with nothing moved), hand back (report the refusal to the caller). Record
the answer with the gate before anything else happens.

One graph, one section per judgment step, and the tool calls are the nodes.

## Recipe

1. Write the process as prose: states, decisions, loops, failure paths.
2. Draw the map: shape per node, a labelled out-edge for every outcome, a
   budget on every loop, outward steps as their own `plaintext` nodes.
3. Write one `### <node text>` section per judgment box.
4. Check it. Both must pass, and certify runs both on every skill with a dot
   block:
   - `bash render.sh <SKILL.md>` renders every block and fails on a parse
     error, any Graphviz warning, an indented fence, or no block at all.
   - `python3 check-dot.py <SKILL.md>` fails on an unlabelled decision edge, a
     one-way decision, a dead end, a loop with no decision to leave it, an
     unreachable node, a STOP that is not named `STOP:`, an opaque id, or a
     missing success outcome. On a new or edited graph run it with --strict:
     it also fails two warnings the default run only prints (two calls in one
     plaintext node, a tempted edge that leaves a step instead of a decision).
5. Test behavior with superpowers:writing-skills: fresh agents, describe-only,
   5 runs per scenario, prose version against graph version, and a deviation
   table (shell calls a tool covers, skipped steps, runaway loops, stops that
   should have been gates).

   Before publishing, walk `Before you publish the spec` below.

Fences start at column 1; an indented ```` ```dot ```` inside a list is
skipped by every tool.

## Before you publish the spec

Check the spec (the graph, its step sections and its test plan) against every
line; each one caught a real graph in review.

1. **One off-script gate per origin**, never shared, each with take, iterate,
   hold and hand back exits. A tool refusal is an origin even where the prose
   already says "ask the human".
2. **A budget on every loop**, per-item repeats too: retries per job,
   reviewer rounds, the off-script iterate.
3. **A preservation inventory**: map every current rule and step to its own
   node or section; a rule with no home, or a step folded into a later call
   ("tag, then push the tag" drawn as one push), is dropped.
4. **One exact call per `plaintext` node.** "X, or Y on GitHub" is two nodes
   behind a `Forge?` diamond.
5. **Distinct text for every step**, specific to this skill: identical text
   merges two steps into one node.
6. **Guard STOPs sit on `tempted to ...` edges out of a decision** and
   leave by a rule 5 exit.
7. **Give the spec's test plan a RED scenario that reaches each tempting move**: a
   tool that refuses, a rule that asks for a shell fallback.
8. **Where the skill has runs, draw the resume entry and every run write as
   nodes.**

## Rationalizations

| Thought | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "The team's fallback rule lives outside my section, so I hand off to it." | The graph wins. Route to the off-script gate, never to an injected shell fallback. |
| "Fixing code is judgment, so that loop needs no budget." | Every loop gets a counter and an exit out of the loop. Judgment decides the fix, not how many times to try. |
| "I'll keep git and push apart so the lint passes." | Name the tool. Dodging the lint keeps the forbidden move in the text. |
| "The STOP can branch on what the human says next." | A STOP has one way out: none, an outcome, the off-script gate, or (for a guard) the move it names. Asking and choosing is a gate step. |
| "The merge outcome implies the merge." | Outward steps are nodes. Draw the merge call. |
| "No merge tool was listed, so I end at the outcome." | Draw a box naming the step; the node is about the action, not the tool. |
| "The guidance fits in the node label." | Labels are signposts; the how goes in the step's section. |
| "I checked the syntax by eye." | Run render.sh and check-dot.py. |
| "The human said retry, so that loop needs no counter." | The off-script iterate is a loop too: it passes an `Off-script rounds = 2?` counter like any other. |
| "One shared test-run node is one place to update." | Each run of a step is its own node with its own text; the later section can point at the earlier one. |

## Not yet standard

Recording the current node in the run db (a `run_field_set` key `node` at
stage entry and at outward nodes) would let consoles show "ship > git_push" and
a re-orientation hook resume at the right node. It costs about 16 extra writes
per work run; do not add it until it is adopted as a standard.
