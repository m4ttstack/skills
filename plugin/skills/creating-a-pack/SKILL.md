name: creating-a-pack
description: Use when a team wants the mattstack pipeline on a repo that has no pack yet -- "make a pack", "set up /<team>:work", "we want the work pipeline on our repo", "onboard our team to mattstack", or when no pack of the team's is installed. Not for adding rules or verbs to a pack that already exists.

# Creating a pack

A pack is a plugin in the team's zone: a verb roster, a bindings fragment,
and (later) domain fills. `rt skills init` writes all of it; this skill runs
that verb, proves the result, and offers the first rules. One zone holds
one pack, named after the zone's namespace.

Walk this map to the end; a pack is not done until it is published.

## Prerequisites

| check | command | pass |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rt daemon | `rt_verb {args: ["daemon", "status"]}` | `"state":"running"` |
| mattstack plugin | `claude plugin list --json` | an id starting `mattstack@` |
| superpowers | `claude plugin list --json` | an id starting `superpowers@` |
| a GitLab remote | `git remote get-url origin` | host is a GitLab host |

## Steps

### Name each miss and the command that installs it

Report the missing thing and the command that installs it: `rt setup pack`,
run once and not routine, covers the first three rows. Do not improvise a
substitute.

### Ask the author: which team, and a remote it owns

A zone is a directory under `~/.mattstack/teams/` whose
`mattstack/mattstack.jsonc` says `role: team`. When the team is unclear,
ask which team this is before running anything.

When the team has no zone of its own, `rt team create <Name> --remote <url>`
makes one. It is a one-time setup call, not routine, and the remote is an
empty repo the team owns. Ask the author for that URL; never invent one.

### Relay error.message verbatim

A refusal is `{ "error": { "code", "message", "refused": true } }`, and
nothing was written. Relay `error.message` word for word, then read
`error.code`:

- `zone-missing` (outside a TTY): the team has no zone yet.
- `zone-has-pack`: the zone found already belongs to another team's pack,
  so this team needs a zone of its own, made the same way.

Both go back to the author for a team and a remote; count every init run
toward the budget of two.

### Relay error.message and error.wrote

A post-write failure is
`{ "error": { "code", "message", "refused": false, "wrote": [...] } }`:
init wrote files before it failed. Relay `error.message` and the
`error.wrote` list so the author sees what exists now.

### Remove the pack dir

Only after `write-failed`: that code's remedy is to remove the pack dir and
run init again. Remove the pack dir that `error.wrote` names, and nothing
else in the zone. The re-run counts toward the same budget.

### Follow the printed remedy

Do exactly what the printed remedy says. Never re-run init on a written
pack.

### End the turn

Queue the reload with rt:herdr-inject, then end the turn. `/reload-plugins`
loads the new pack in place, and the queued Continue line resumes this pane
on the next step.

### Run tryNext on a small real ticket

Run `tryNext` with a small real ticket. "Works" means, after the reload: a
branch or worktree, an APPROACH block printed, a commit, an MR, and a CI
verdict. Every stage runs its generic path; that is the expected shape of a
pack with no fills.

### Name each fallback the run took

Name each fallback in the report, for example: the provisioner did not know
the repo, so the branch was made in the checkout.

The `work` verb's description in `pack/stubs.jsonc` is a placeholder seeded
from the engine. Rewording it in the team's words is the first, smallest
edit; `mattstack:extending-a-pack` covers it.

### Ask the author to type /reload-plugins, then paste tryNext

`/reload-plugins` loads the new pack in the author's session in place.
Then they paste `tryNext` with a small real ticket.

### Report: scaffolded, proof pending

Until the first `/<pack>:work` run has reported back, the pack is
scaffolded, not proven: say "scaffolded, proof pending". When the run in
this pane stopped short of a CI verdict, name the stage it stopped at.
When the author runs it, their reloaded session owns the report. A hand-off
is not a proof.

### Ask the first-rules question once

Ask exactly this:

> Are any of your team's rules already written down (CONTRIBUTING, a review
> checklist, branch rules, a release checklist)?

### Hand each rule to extending-a-pack, one per round

Each yes is one round of `mattstack:extending-a-pack`, one rule per round.

### Say rules can be added any time

No is a complete answer. Say that rules can be added any time with
`mattstack:extending-a-pack`.

### Push the zone's default branch

Ahead means the daemon's snapshot committed but could not push. From the
zone checkout, a bare push (`git_push` refuses a default branch):

`git push` <!-- mcp-lint: allow -->

Never force.

### Wait for the daemon's snapshot commit

The daemon's team snapshot commits the zone on its own within a minute of
init: a `snapshot:` commit covering the pack dir, `team.jsonc`, and
`marketplace.json`. Give it that minute before the next status check.

### Gate: init budget spent

Quote each init envelope's `error.message` (and `error.wrote` after a
write) and propose the next move: the zone and remote to use, or what to
clear. Retry: the human fixed it; run init again. Takes over: the human
runs init.

### Gate: remedy did not complete the pack

Quote the remedy and what is still missing, and propose the next move.
Retry: follow the remedy again with the human's note. Takes over: the pack
stays as init and the remedy left it, for the human.

### Gate: zone push rejected

Quote the rejection and propose the next move (bring in the remote change,
fix the credentials). Never force. Retry: the human fixed it; push again.
Takes over: the commit stays local for the human to push.

### Gate: snapshot never landed

Quote the three `git status -sb` results and propose the next move (check
the daemon is running with `rt_verb {args: ["daemon", "status"]}`, or the
human commits the zone). Retry: the human fixed it; check the status again.
Takes over: the human commits and pushes the zone.

## What the graph cannot show

- Name the zone and the app repo explicitly on init, never relying on the
  current directory. Without `--zone`, init picks by detection (the zone
  declaring this repo, else the one packless zone on the host), which can
  land the pack in another team's zone.
- An ok envelope is `{ "ok": true, ... }` and carries `pack.name`,
  `pack.dir`, `tryNext` and `restartNeeded`. `restartNeeded` is always
  true; the reload runs in place, never a restart.
- Before `git status -sb`, `cd <zone checkout>` as its own Bash call.
- At `Pack published`, however the zone got there, say that teammates
  receive the pack through `rt setup`, and hand any later change to
  `mattstack:editing-skills`.

## Writing fills later

Before a fill tells an agent to run a command, open
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../../attachments/mcp-tools/reference.md` (the
`mcp-tools` reference): every rt call, forge call and git write a pipeline
needs has a tool there, except the few its header lists as staying on Bash
(`git commit` is one). The fill's sentence names that tool (a push is
`git_push {tree: <checkout>}`), not the command, and `rt skills check` <!-- mcp-lint: allow -->
flags the shell form. `rt skills audit --pack <pack>` is the slower read
for plain-words instructions.

A fill or pack skill that describes a process of its own (a trigger, steps,
an end) gets a digraph map per mattstack:process-digraphs. A fill that only
adds rules to an engine's steps keys its sections to that step's node text,
and never adds a move the engine's graph marks STOP.

## Red flags

- Creating directories or `plugin.json` by hand: init writes them.
- Copying another team's pack: its fills carry that team's rules.
- A `.mattstack/skills.jsonc` inside the repo: the compiler reads the
  per-repo manifest under `~/.mattstack/repos/`, not the repo.
- Writing a fill "to have something there": fills are optional and each one
  is written through `superpowers:writing-skills` when the rule exists.
