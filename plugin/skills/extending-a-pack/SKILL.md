description: Use when a team pack already exists and it should know something new -- "add a rule to our pack", "the pipeline should X on our repo", "make ship run lint first", "add a ship/review/watch-ci verb", "reword the work description" -- or right after a generic stage missed a team rule. Not for creating the pack (see creating-a-pack) or publishing it (see editing-skills).

# Extending a pack

One ask per round. The ask lands in exactly one of four places; the rule
itself is written by the author, in their words, as a real skill.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `superpowers:writing-skills` for every `context`
skill and every fill. Baseline first, then write, then re-run.

The output of one round, in this order, each part required:

1. the ask sorted to one place (section 1)
2. a RED record: the stage or verb run without the rule, the miss quoted
3. the skill or fill written, in the fill's frontmatter form
4. bound, certified, checked, with the fragment carrying the binding
5. handed to `mattstack:editing-skills` to publish

## 1. Sort the ask

| the ask is about | goes to |
| --- | --- |
| a rule that holds even outside a pipeline (branch names, forbidden ops, where things live) | `skills/context/SKILL.md`, a hand-authored public skill |
| something one stage or verb should do differently | a fill bound to that stage's `domain` slot (or the review cluster's `criteria` / `reply-rules`) |
| a new door: `ship`, `review`, `watch-ci`, `self-review`, `receive-review`, `shepherdr` | a roster entry in `pack/stubs.jsonc` plus `rt skills surface set <verb> --public` |
| the wording of an existing verb | its `description` in `pack/stubs.jsonc` |

`slots.md` beside this file maps asks to slots and contracts.
`rt skills composition --pack <pack>` is the live list; use it when the
table and the pack disagree.

## 2. Write it (context or fill)

Paths: `<zone>/mattstack/packs/<pack>/skills/context/SKILL.md` for context,
`<zone>/mattstack/packs/<pack>/attachments/<fill>/SKILL.md` for a fill.
`rt skills packs` prints the pack dir.

A fill has this frontmatter and nothing else in it:

```markdown
---
name: <fill>
description: "Use when mattstack:<engine> resolves its <slot> slot here; the pack manifest binds <contract> to this skill. Not for manual invocation."
disable-model-invocation: true
metadata:
  provides: "<contract>"
---
```

RED, in the author's repo, in a worktree: run the stage or verb without the
rule on a small real task (`/<pack>:work` for a stage, `/<pack>:ship` for a
door) and record verbatim where it missed the rule. Running the tool the
rule is about (the linter, the test runner) in the checkout is not the RED
pass; it tests the tool, not the pipeline. Then write the body: the rule,
its reason, and the decision it changes. The stage keeps its own flow; the
fill carries only what the team adds. Re-run: the miss is gone.

## 3. Bind, certify, check

```bash
rt skills bind <stage-or-verb> <slot> <pack>:<fill>     # validates provides, writes the per-repo manifest AND pack/skills.jsonc, recompiles
sh <mattstack-skills>/tests/certify.sh <fill dir> --domain
rt skills check --pack <pack>
```

The write into `pack/skills.jsonc` is what reaches teammates; the per-repo
manifest is regenerated on every materialize. Confirm the fragment carries
the new `bindings` entry before moving on.

A verb-level bind (`mattstack:ship`) needs the door rostered first; the
stage-level bind (`mattstack:stage-ship`) works either way. Bind both when
both exist. `context` needs no bind: it is public by being under `skills/`;
add it to `pack/surface.jsonc`'s `public` list.

## 4. Doors and wording

Add a roster entry with the engine name and a trigger-only description in
the team's words, then `rt skills surface set <verb> --public` and
`rt skills compile --pack <pack>`. Rewording is the same edit without the
surface step. A `shepherdr` door also needs its two required slots bound
(`tiering` to `mattstack:model-tiering`, `strategy` to
`mattstack:execution-strategy`) before it compiles.

## 5. Publish

Hand to `mattstack:editing-skills`: bump, commit, push, `rt skills sync`,
restart. The daemon's team snapshot may commit the zone first; that is
fine, the bump and push still go through editing-skills.

## Red flags

- Editing anything under `skills/<verb>/` or `attachments/stage-*/`: compiled
  output, overwritten by the next compile.
- Editing the mattstack engine in the plugin cache: every team's compile
  reads it, and the next update erases the edit.
- Editing `~/.mattstack/repos/<slug>/skills.jsonc` by hand: regenerated on
  the next materialize; the fragment is the source.
- A fill body that restates the engine: the fill carries only what the team
  adds.
- Binding before the fill exists: `rt skills bind` refuses; write first.
- "The next real run is the first live test": that is the RED and GREEN
  pass skipped; run them.
