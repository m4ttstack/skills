# Extending a pack

One ask per round. The ask lands in exactly one of four places; the rule
itself is written by the author, in their words, as a real skill.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `superpowers:writing-skills` for every `context`
skill and every fill. Baseline first, then write, then re-run.

Walk this map once per ask; the round is not done until GREEN is recorded or the ask needs no rule.

## Calling the skills verbs

Skills verbs go through `rt_verb {args: [...]}`: `--pack <pack>` sits in
`args`, and the call never carries a `cwd`. `--pack-dir <dir>` rides in
`args` for `check` only; compiling a checkout's or worktree's sources is
the bare Bash `rt skills compile --pack <pack> --pack-dir <dir>`, because <!-- mcp-lint: allow -->
`rt_verb` refuses that flag on compile. `rt skills composition` and
`rt skills packs` refuse `rt_verb` (not agent-safe); run them as plain
Bash, and only as a one-time lookup, not a per-round call.

## Steps

### Sort the ask

| the ask is about | goes to |
| --- | --- |
| a rule that holds even outside a pipeline (branch names, forbidden ops, where things live) | `skills/context/SKILL.md`, a hand-authored public skill |
| something one stage or verb should do differently | a fill bound to that stage's `domain` slot (or the review cluster's `criteria` / `reply-rules`) |
| a new door: `ship`, `review`, `watch-ci`, `self-review`, `receive-review`, `shepherdr` | a roster entry in `pack/stubs.jsonc` plus `rt_verb {args: ["skills", "surface", "set", "<verb>", "--public", "--pack", "<pack>"]}` |
| the wording of an existing verb | its `description` in `pack/stubs.jsonc` |

`slots.md` beside this file maps asks to slots and contracts.
`rt skills composition --pack <pack>` (Bash, one-time) is the live list; use
it when the table and the pack disagree.

### Add the roster entry in pack/stubs.jsonc

The entry names the engine and carries a trigger-only description in the
team's words.

### Reword the description in pack/stubs.jsonc

Change only the verb's `description`: trigger-only, in the team's words.
The verb is already on the surface.

### RED: run the stage or verb without the rule

In the author's repo, in a worktree: run the stage or verb without the rule
on a small real task (`/<pack>:work` for a stage, `/<pack>:ship` for a
door) and record verbatim where it missed the rule.

A worktree isolates files, not the remote. When the ask concerns `ship`,
answer the ship gate with proceed and stop at the push or MR-create command
itself (a ship fill's rules run after the gate). When it concerns
`watch-ci`, run against a branch and MR that already exist on the remote.

Running the tool the rule is about (the linter, the test runner) in the
checkout is not the RED pass; it tests the tool, not the pipeline.

### Write the rule in the author's words

Paths: `<zone>/mattstack/packs/<pack>/skills/context/SKILL.md` for context,
`<zone>/mattstack/packs/<pack>/attachments/<fill>/SKILL.md` for a fill.
`rt skills packs` (Bash, one-time) prints the pack dir.

A fill has this frontmatter and nothing else in it:

```markdown
---
name: <fill>
description: "Use when mattstack:<engine> resolves its <slot> slot here; the pack manifest binds <contract> to this skill. Not for manual invocation."
disable-model-invocation: true
metadata:
  provides: "<contract>"
---
```

The body: the rule, its reason, and the decision it changes. The stage
keeps its own flow; the fill carries only what the team adds.

Before a fill tells an agent to run a command, open
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../../attachments/mcp-tools/reference.md` (the
`mcp-tools` reference): every rt call, forge call and git write a pipeline
needs has a tool there, except the few its header lists as staying on Bash
(`git commit` is one). The fill's sentence names that tool (a push is
`git_push {tree: <checkout>}`), not the command, and `rt skills check` <!-- mcp-lint: allow -->
flags the shell form. `rt skills audit --pack <pack>` is the slower read
for plain-words instructions.

A fill or pack skill that describes a process of its own (a trigger, steps,
an end) gets a digraph map per mattstack:process-digraphs. A fill that only
adds rules to an engine's steps keys its sections to that step's node text,
and never adds a move the engine's graph marks STOP.

### Fix what the refusal names

The bind validates `provides`, writes the per-repo manifest AND
`pack/skills.jsonc`, and recompiles. It refuses:

- a fill that does not exist yet: write it first;
- a `provides` that does not match the slot's contract;
- a verb-level bind (`mattstack:ship`) before the door is rostered. The
  stage-level bind (`mattstack:stage-ship`) works either way. Bind both
  when both exist.

### Add it to pack/surface.jsonc public

`context` needs no bind: it is public by being under `skills/`. Add it to
`pack/surface.jsonc`'s `public` list.

### Read what moved on Bash

Through `rt_verb`, a check that comes back `failed (exit 1)` is drift, with
only the tail of its output. The bare Bash check names what moved on each
stale line:

`rt skills check --pack <pack>` <!-- mcp-lint: allow -->

### Fix what failed

Fix the source the output names: a certify `FAIL` in the skill or fill you
wrote, a stale line by compiling again with
`rt_verb {args: ["skills", "compile", "--pack", "<pack>"]}`. A fill edited
after its bind reads as stale until that compile.

### Re-run the same stage on the same task

The running session still loads the pack from the installed cache, so GREEN
runs in a fresh `claude --plugin-dir <pack dir>` session in the worktree,
where the pack's verbs come from its source, after the fill is bound or
compiled again. In it, re-run the same stage or verb on the same task with
the same stop point, and record that the miss is gone.

### Revise the rule

Revise the same source file against the miss the last run showed. The
revision is not tested in the session that ran the last GREEN: that
session still holds the old text, so exit it and start a fresh
`claude --plugin-dir <pack dir>` once the fill is compiled again.

### Gate: bind refused twice

Quote both refusals and propose the fix (write the fill, correct
`provides`, roster the door first). Retry: the author fixed it; bind again,
with `Bind attempts` starting again at zero. Takes over: the fill stays
written and unbound for the author.

### Gate: fix rounds spent

Quote the last certify `FAIL` lines or the bare check's stale lines, and
propose the fix you would try next. Retry: the author fixed it; certify
again, with `Fix rounds` starting again at zero. Takes over: the author
finishes the change.

### Gate: fragment still missing the binding

Quote the bind results and the `bindings` in `pack/skills.jsonc`, and
propose the next move (the stage-level bind, or the author adds the entry).
Retry: the author fixed it; bind again, with `Fragment checks` starting
again at zero. Takes over: the author finishes the binding.

### Gate: GREEN rounds spent

Quote the miss from each GREEN run and propose the revision you would try
next. Retry: revise with the author's note, with `GREEN rounds` starting
again at zero. Takes over: the author finishes the rule.

## What the graph cannot show

- The write into `pack/skills.jsonc` is what reaches teammates; the
  per-repo manifest is regenerated on every materialize. That is why the
  fragment, not the manifest, is checked for the new `bindings` entry.
- When the ask has both a stage level and a verb level (`mattstack:stage-ship`
  and `mattstack:ship`), bind both, one bind call each.
- A `context` skill is certified the same way,
  `sh <mattstack-skills>/tests/certify.sh <context dir> --domain`.
- A `shepherdr` door compiles only with its two required slots bound:
  `tiering` to `mattstack:model-tiering`, `strategy` to
  `mattstack:execution-strategy`.

## Publish

Hand to `mattstack:editing-skills`: bump, commit, push,
`rt_verb {args: ["skills", "sync", "--pack", "<pack>"]}`, restart. The daemon's team snapshot may commit the zone first; that is
fine, the bump and push still go through editing-skills.

## Red flags

- The STOP node covers compiled output and the plugin cache: the next compile or update erases the edit.
- Editing `~/.mattstack/repos/<slug>/skills.jsonc` by hand: regenerated on
  the next materialize; the fragment is the source.
- A fill body that restates the engine: the fill carries only what the team
  adds.
- Binding before the fill exists: `rt_verb {args: ["skills", "bind", ...]}` refuses; write first.
- "The next real run is the first live test": that is the RED and GREEN
  pass skipped; run them.
