# ship

The standalone entry for shipping the current branch. Same flow as the
pipeline's ship stage, reached directly: target from the checkout. Two
graphs: the run graph opens or inherits the run, the flow graph ships and
closes it. The domain rules below run their own steps in their own order;
the flow graph is where every mechanical move in them lands.

## Run

```

An own run is a fresh or resumed one: it records identity and closes at the
end. An inherited run records no identity, closes nothing, and hands
control back to the verb that invoked this one.

The flags for this verb, rendered by the compiler:

{{run-start.flags:ship}}

`run_start` takes `flags` = the `ship` flag string from the block above,
verbatim (the value, never its key), `skillDir` = this skill's own
directory, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, as an absolute path, and `spawnedBy` only
when a board or another surface launched this pane. Keep the returned
`runDb` and pass it to every `run_*` call in this verb; nothing is exported.
Every gate below writes its `gate` field and its decision with
`stage: "ship"` in an own run, `stage: run.current_stage` in an inherited
one.

### ship gate clarify: the Resume offer

`run_list` filtered to `status` = `running` and `work_type` = `ship`; never
read the run dbs by hand. Gate `clarify`: one sentence naming each
candidate's `spawned_by`, `started_at` and `current_stage`, then one
**Resume** option per candidate (recommended for a run this session started
earlier; a run another live pane owns is not yours) / **Start fresh**, and
**Hold** in `next`.

### Build runDb from the candidate's id (ship)

`runDb` = `<absolute home>/.mattstack/runs/<repo>/<the candidate row's id>/state.db`.
The run tools refuse `~` and relative paths. The `run_stage` start is a new
attempt that re-records this session.

### Use the runs root the error names (ship)

Rebuild `runDb` under the runs root the refusal names; everything after the
root stays the same.

{{include:run-identity}}

## Flow

`<root>` is the worktree root, the absolute path
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` prints. `<default>` is the repo's default
branch, `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` minus
`origin/`, never guessed.

### Run the domain steps before the gate (none when unbound)

The domain's gathering steps: sanity of the diff against the ticket, the
branch and ticket checks, an existing-MR lookup, any mandatory pre-ship
review. Each one that raises a question adds it to the `ship` gate rather
than asking on its own. Unbound, there are none.

### ship gate ship

Before anything is pushed. One sentence above the form: the branch, the
commits about to go, and whether the tree is dirty. When the gate reopens
with a rebase in progress (the conflict rounds are spent), the context says
so, and Abort aborts that rebase first.

| Question | Options (recommended first) | Shown when |
|---|---|---|
| `dirty` | **Commit the changes** / **Stash them** / **Abort** | the tree is dirty |
| `open_as` | **Push and open as draft** / **Push and open ready** | always |
| the domain's own | as the domain rules word them (a ticket mismatch, an MR already open) | the domain declares them |
| `next` | **Proceed** / **Iterate here** / **Hold** | always |

Scope `ship`. Selection: `{"dirty":"commit|stash|abort|null","open_as":"draft|ready","domain":{<answers>},"next":"proceed|iterate|hold","note":"<their words or null>"}`.
Abort and Hold push nothing.

### Commit named files (ship)

Stage the files by name, never everything; the subject follows the
domain's commit rules, the branch's own style when unbound.

### Stash them; nothing in this verb pops it

A tagged stash (`git stash push -u -m "<unique tag>"`); the git stash stack
is shared with every worktree, so never pop by position. Say in the final
report that the stash exists.

### Run the domain's fast checks (none when unbound)

Only the checks the domain names, on the changed files. Revert generated
drift the checks leave behind before continuing. A full suite the domain
rules out stays out: CI runs it. A finished rebase, clean or resolved,
sends the checks round again because the tree changed under them; the "no
rebase finished this pass" guard keeps that second round from rebasing
again.

### Fix test-first, commit, rerun (ship)

Each fix gets its failing test first, then the fix, then a commit. The
counter is fix rounds within this pass through the verb.

### Resolve the files, then git rebase --continue on Bash (ship)

Resolve each conflicted file `git_rebase` returned, then continue the
rebase on Bash (no tool continues one). A later commit that conflicts
counts as another round. A finished rebase goes back to the fast checks,
like a clean one.

### ship gate clarify: which forge?

The origin host is neither GitLab nor GitHub. Ask which forge it is, quoting
the `git remote get-url origin` line as the context.

### ship off-script gate: git_push refused

Scope `off-script:<stage>:<n>` (`n` counts from 1 within the stage
attempt), `context` quoting the refusal.

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| `action` | **Take the proposed move** (the value spells the move in full, such as the human pushing, or a fixed tree registration and a retry) / **Hand back** |
| `next` | **Proceed** (Recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Hold** |

Selection: `{"move":"<the move>","why":"<the refusal>","action":"take|handback","next":"proceed|iterate|hold","note":"<their words or null>"}`.

### Confirm the human's push landed (ship)

The human pushed outside this verb. Compare `git rev-parse HEAD` with the
remote branch and say what it shows in the final report; never push from
here. The push landed when the remote branch carries HEAD; otherwise the
off-script gate reopens with the comparison as its context.

### Capture the AFTER when the domain names one (ship)

The same view as the domain's BEFORE, on the sha just pushed. The counter
is attempts within this pass; after the third failure, ship without it and
say in the description what was tried. Unbound, there is no AFTER.

### Write the title and description (ship)

Title from the ticket or the first commit subject; the body links the
ticket and every attachment, with the upload markdown where it exists. The
update replaces the whole body, so start from the one just read back: keep
what is already there (a teammate's edits) and change only what this verb
owns. The domain's title, template and voice rules win over this paragraph.

### Run watch-ci inheriting this run

Invoke the `watch-ci` verb with this run's `runDb`, so it inherits the run
and fires no gate beyond `ci`. Hand it the forge, the MR, the pushed sha
(`git rev-parse HEAD` after the push) and, when one was kept, the prior
pipeline id. The prior id is read only when the push moves the branch (the
open MR's sha from `mr_for_branch` differs from `git rev-parse HEAD`), so
the sha guard can tell the new pipeline from the old one; with no prior id
handed over, the guard checks the sha alone. It hands back its verdict (after its `ci` gate when red),
an off-script answer, a failure, a stand-down, or a hold. A stand-down means
the doctor holds the MR's lease: an own run closes `done`, since the MR
exists, and the report says the doctor has it; an inherited run hands the
stand-down back.

### ship gate mark-ready

Green, and the MR still a draft. One sentence above the form: CI is green;
the attachments are there (or are not).

| Question | Options (recommended first) | Shown when |
|---|---|---|
| `ready` | **Mark ready now** (when CI is green and the evidence is attached) / **Keep it draft** | always |
| `next` | **Proceed** / **Iterate here** / **Go back** / **Hold** | always; **Go back** only in an inherited run |
| `to` | one option per earlier stage, split `to-1`, `to-2`, ... over 4; with exactly one candidate it labels **Go back to `<stage>`** in `next` instead | Go back answered and `run_snapshot` shows more than one earlier stage row |

Scope `mark-ready`. Selection: `{"ready":true|false,"next":"proceed|iterate|redirect|hold","to":"<stage or null>","note":"<their words or null>"}`.

## What the graph cannot show

- After a rebase that rewrote already-pushed commits, push with
  `git_push {tree: <root>, forceWithLease: true}` instead, and only once
  you have seen its checks pass in this session. Never force otherwise.
- Keep the `url` `mr_create` returns as `mrUrl` for every later write, and
  print it. `mr_create` takes `draft: false` only when the gate said ready;
  write its title from the branch's commits.
- A hold at any gate leaves the run open: the turn ends naming the run and
  the gate, and nothing closes.

## Domain rules

If a rule below asks for a move this graph marks STOP, take the off-script edge instead.

{{slot:domain}}

When nothing is inlined above, the graph alone is the flow: no steps before
the gate, no fast checks, no rebase, no AFTER, no CI watch.
