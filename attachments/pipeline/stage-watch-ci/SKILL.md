# stage: watch-ci

{{stage.fields}}

## Run state

Contracts v2 and v3 (authoritative text: the parameterized-skills skill's convention reference).

- First action: `run_stage` with `action: "start"`, `stage: "watch-ci"` and the run's `runDb`.
- Read consumed fields with `run_field_get` before deriving or asking for them.
- Write each declared produce the moment it exists with `run_field_set` (`key`, `value`, `stage: "watch-ci"`).
- Last action on success: `run_stage` with `action: "done"`; on failure `run_stage` with `action: "fail"`, a `reason` naming what actually failed and `detailPath` = the path to the triage report, before you report it.

## Where the scripts live

The engine's watcher, triage, and attendant scripts are vendored inside
this compiled skill's own directory, and the forge adapter beside them. In
the commands below, `<scripts>` is `{{stage.dir}}/scripts/` and `<forge>` is
`{{stage.dir}}/parts/forge/scripts/ci-forge.sh`. Nothing is derived from a
plugin install; the paths are the ones written into this text.

## Domain rules

{{slot:domain}}

When nothing is inlined above, follow the generic path below.

## Forge

{{slot:forge}}

## The attendant lease (before any watching, when `mr` is set)

Exactly one actor attends an MR's CI at a time: this stage, or the
mr-board auto-doctor. Both honor the same lease files
(`~/.mattstack/ci-attendants/`), and the doctor's dispatcher skips MRs
you hold. Claim before doing anything else:

`"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ci-attendant.sh" claim <mr-url> <iid> --branch <branch>`

- **Exit 0**: the MR is yours. Proceed.
- **Exit 3**: the auto-doctor is actively repairing this MR. STAND DOWN:
  report it and stop, or watch READ-ONLY. A repair action is any commit,
  push, or job retry; while the doctor holds the lease, every one of
  them belongs to the doctor.

While watching, refresh each poll round with
`ci-attendant.sh heartbeat <mr-url> <iid>`; a lease without heartbeats
goes stale in 10 minutes and the doctor may take over. When the stage
finishes (verdict written, or you stop), release with
`ci-attendant.sh release <mr-url> <iid>`. A crashed session needs no
cleanup: staleness handles it.

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The doctor's on it, but I can fix it faster" | Two actors pushing to one branch race each other's work. Stand down or watch read-only. |
| "I'll just retry the flaky job while the doctor works" | A retry IS a repair action. The lease holder does it, not you. |
| "No time for the lease, the pipeline just went red" | The claim is one command and beats un-racing two half-pushed fixes. |

## Watch and triage

Then the first branch that matches:

**Domain rules inlined above:** follow that flow for `mr` and `branch`.
Its red verdict lands at the `ci` gate below and its green at
`mark-ready`.

**Forge bound (no domain rules above):** launch
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ci-watch.sh --forge {{stage.dir}}/parts/forge/scripts/ci-forge.sh --ref <branch> --timeout 2700`
as a background task and react to its exit code: 0 = green, on to the
mark-ready gate below. 1 = read the triage report it printed; retry each
INFRA-verdict blocking failure once with the retry command the report
prints and relaunch the watcher; any REAL blocking failure is the `ci`
gate below. 2 = the pipeline outran the timeout: relaunch the watcher
once, then the `ci` gate. 4 = no pipeline ever appeared: verify the branch
was pushed, then the `ci` gate.

**Neither bound:** every GitLab MR tool call in this stage targets the
MR with `repoName` = this worktree's absolute path and `iid` = the iid in
`mr`. On GitLab poll the `mr_pipeline` tool (`repoName`, `iid`; live by
default) until the pipeline settles, then `mr_job_trace` (`repoName`,
`iid`, `jobId`) for each failed job; on GitHub
`gh pr checks <mr> --watch`. GitLab with no MR: do not poll; go straight
to the `ci` gate with the reason "no MR to watch; ship first".
Green: the mark-ready gate below. Red: read the failing job log, classify
REAL (the change broke it) vs INFRA/flake (unrelated, retry once: on
GitLab the `mr_retry` tool with `repoName`, `iid`, and the failed job's
id as `jobId`); any REAL failure is the `ci` gate below.

## Gate `ci` (red, timeout, or no pipeline)

- `run_field_set` with `key: "gate"`, `value: "ci:watch-ci:<attempt>"`, `stage: "watch-ci"`
- One sentence: the verdict and the one-line triage per blocking failure.
- Run gate-protocol's Runs integration with kind `ci:watch-ci:<attempt>`
  and these questions, each its own question (never fold one list into
  another -- a question over 4 options sends the whole gate to the wait
  queue):
  - `action`: **Fix and re-push** (recommended for a REAL failure in
    your change) / **Retry the job** (for a flake the report did not
    already retry) / **Hand back** (leave it red for the human) /
    **Abandon the run**
  - `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Go back to
    `<stage>`** / **Hold**
- `run_decision` with `contract: "gate@1"`, `scope: "ci:watch-ci:<attempt>"`, `selection: {"next":"fix|retry|handback|abandon|iterate|redirect|hold","to":"<stage or null>","note":"<their words or null>"}`, `decidedBy: <the answer's by>`
- Fix: write no `ci`; hand control back to the orchestrator with one
  sentence naming the answer, and it redirects to `implement` with the
  triage as the reason (the work engine's `## Redirect`; the gate answer
  is what names the stage). Retry, forge bound: the report's retry
  command, relaunch the watcher. Retry, neither bound: on GitLab the
  `mr_retry` tool with `repoName`, `iid`, and the failed job's id as
  `jobId`; on GitHub `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`, the run id taken
  from the failed check's link in `gh pr checks <mr>`; then re-enter
  Watch and triage. Hand back: write `ci` as `red: <triage>` and
  `run_stage` with `action: "done"`. Abandon: `run_status` with
  `status: "abandoned"`.

## Gate `mark-ready` (green, `mr` set, MR still a draft)

- `run_field_set` with `key: "gate"`, `value: "mark-ready"`, `stage: "watch-ci"`
- One sentence: CI is green for the MR's head; `evidence` is set (or is
  `-`).
- Run gate-protocol's Runs integration with kind `mark-ready` and these
  questions, each its own question (never fold one list into another --
  a question over 4 options sends the whole gate to the wait queue):
  - `ready`: **Mark ready now** (recommended when `evidence` is set and
    not `-`) / **Keep it draft**
  - `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Go back** /
    **Hold**
  - `to`, only when **Go back** is answered and more than one earlier
    stage row exists: one option per earlier stage, split `to-1`,
    `to-2`, ... over 4; with exactly one candidate stage label it **Go
    back to `<stage>`** in `next` and skip this question
- `run_decision` with `contract: "gate@1"`, `scope: "mark-ready"`, `selection: {"ready":true|false,"next":"proceed|iterate|redirect|hold","to":"<stage or null>","note":"<their words or null>"}`, `decidedBy: <the answer's by>`
- Go back: hand control back to the orchestrator with one sentence naming
  the answer; it runs `## Redirect`.
- Yes: the forge-host rule (read `git remote get-url origin`; GitLab means
  the `mr_ready` tool with `repoName`, `iid`, GitHub means
  `gh pr ready <number>`, anything else is a `clarify` gate).

Finish by writing `ci` (`green`, or `red: <one-line triage>` when the
human handed it back). The exit-2 and exit-4 paths write no `ci` until
the gate's answer produces a verdict: the stage is not done until one
exists.
