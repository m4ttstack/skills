# stage: watch-ci

{{stage.fields}}

Run state: the orchestrator opens and closes this stage, so never write
`run_stage` `start` or `done` here. Read consumes with `run_field_get`,
write `ci` with `run_field_set` (`stage: "watch-ci"`) once a verdict
exists, and on failure write `run_stage {action: fail, stage: "watch-ci",
reason, detailPath}` with `detailPath` = the triage report.

`<scripts>` is `{{stage.dir}}/scripts/` and `<forge>` is
`{{stage.dir}}/parts/forge/scripts/ci-forge.sh`: the watcher, triage and
attendant scripts are vendored beside this file. GitLab MR tools take
`repoName` = this worktree's absolute path and `iid` = the iid in `mr`.

### Follow the domain's watch flow

The domain's own watch and triage for `mr` and `branch`. Its green verdict
goes to the draft check, and its red, timeout or missing pipeline goes to
the `ci` gate.

### Read the triage report

The watcher prints its report on exit 1: one verdict per blocking failure
(REAL or INFRA) and the retry command for each INFRA one.

### Classify each failure REAL or INFRA

REAL: the change broke it (a test, type or lint failure in touched code).
INFRA: unrelated to the change (a runner, network or dependency outage, a
known flake). One retry per INFRA job; a REAL failure goes to the gate.

## The attendant lease

Exactly one actor attends an MR's CI at a time: this stage or the board's
auto-doctor. Both honour the lease files under `~/.mattstack/ci-attendants/`.
Refresh it each poll round with `<scripts>/ci-attendant.sh heartbeat
<mr-url> <iid>`; a lease without heartbeats goes stale after 10 minutes
and the doctor may take over. A crashed session needs no cleanup.
Release it on every exit that leaves the MR unattended (a written `ci`,
Hold, Go back, Abandon); with `mr` unset nothing was claimed, so skip the
release. Fix and re-push keeps it, because the re-run claims it again, and
Stand down never touches it: that lease is the doctor's.

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The doctor's on it, but I can fix it faster" | Two actors pushing to one branch race each other's work. Stand down or watch read-only. |
| "I'll just retry the flaky job while the doctor works" | A retry is a repair action. The lease holder does it, not you. |
| "No time for the lease, the pipeline just went red" | The claim is one command and beats untangling two half-pushed fixes. |

## Gate `ci` (red, timeout, or no pipeline)

Scope `ci:watch-ci:<attempt>`. One sentence above the form: the verdict
and a one-line triage per blocking failure.

| Question | Options (recommended first) | Shown when |
|---|---|---|
| `action` | **Fix and re-push** (a REAL failure in your change; from the third one in a run, **Hand back** is recommended instead) / **Retry the job** (a flake not yet retried) / **Hand back** (leave it red for the human) / **Abandon the run** | always |
| `next` | **Proceed** / **Iterate here** / **Go back to `<stage>`** / **Hold** | always |

Selection: `{"next":"fix|retry|handback|abandon|iterate|redirect|hold","to":"<stage or null>","note":"<their words or null>"}`.
Retry, forge bound: the report's retry command. Neither bound: `mr_retry`
on GitLab, `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed` on GitHub (the run id from the
failed check's link in `gh pr checks <mr>`).

## Gate `mark-ready` (green, `mr` set, still a draft)

One sentence above the form: CI is green for the MR's head, and whether
`evidence` is set.

| Question | Options (recommended first) | Shown when |
|---|---|---|
| `ready` | **Mark ready now** (when `evidence` is set and not `-`) / **Keep it draft** | always |
| `next` | **Proceed** / **Iterate here** / **Go back** / **Hold** | always |
| `to` | one option per earlier stage, split `to-1`, ... over 4 | Go back answered and more than one earlier stage row |

Selection: `{"ready":true|false,"next":"proceed|iterate|redirect|hold","to":"<stage or null>","note":"<their words or null>"}`.

## Domain rules

The domain and forge rules below supply the watch flow and triage rules.
Where a domain step names a move the graph above marks STOP (a GitLab CLI
read or retry, a repair while the doctor holds the lease), the STOP node
wins.

{{slot:domain}}

When nothing is inlined above, the graph's other flows apply.
