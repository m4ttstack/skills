# stage: watch-ci

{{stage.fields}}

Run state: the orchestrator opens and closes this stage, so never write
`run_stage` `start` or `done` here. Read consumes with `run_field_get`,
write `ci` with `run_field_set` (`stage: "watch-ci"`) once a verdict
exists, and on failure write `run_stage {action: fail, stage: "watch-ci",
reason, detailPath}` with `detailPath` = the triage report.

`<scripts>` is `{{stage.dir}}/scripts/` and `<forge>` is
`{{stage.dir}}/parts/forge/scripts/ci-forge.sh`: the triage script is
vendored beside this file, the forge adapter beside it. GitLab MR tools and
`ci_watch` take `repoName` = this worktree's absolute path and `iid` = the
iid in `mr`; the lease tools take `mrUrl` = `mr`'s https URL.

### Fix what the claim error names (stage)

`ci_lease_claim` refused its input. Correct what the error names (`mrUrl`
must be the MR's https URL, `.../-/merge_requests/<iid>` or `.../pull/<n>`;
`branch` the MR's source branch) and claim again, once.

### Off-script gate: ci_lease_claim refused (gate-protocol, scope off-script:watch-ci:<n>)

`context` quotes both errors. Answers: **Take** (the human attends this MR
themselves: `ci` is written red with the lease error as the triage line) /
**Iterate** (the human fixed it, for example the session id or the URL:
claim again, through `Off-script rounds = 2`) / **Hold** / **Hand back** (a
failure, the refusal is the reason).

### Off-script gate: re-claim refused before the retry (gate-protocol, scope off-script:watch-ci:<n>)

The re-claim before a job retry failed with a tool error. `context` quotes
it. Same four answers as the claim gate above; Iterate re-claims before the
retry.

### Fix what the ci_watch error names (stage)

`ci_watch` refused its input. Correct what the error names (`repoName` the
worktree's absolute path, `iid` a number, `sha` 7 to 40 hex characters,
`priorPipelineId` the number `N` of a `gitlab:pipeline:N` id) and call
again, once. An error is never a reason to watch with a script or the
GitLab CLI.

### Off-script gate: ci_watch refused (gate-protocol, scope off-script:watch-ci:<n>)

`context` quotes both errors. Answers: **Take** (the human reads the
pipeline and reports green or red for the pushed sha) / **Iterate** (the
human fixed it, for example registered the repo with rt: watch again,
through `Off-script rounds = 2`) / **Hold** / **Hand back** (a failure, the
refusal is the reason).

### Verify the branch was pushed (stage)

Nine `ci_watch` calls found no pipeline for the pushed sha. Compare `git
rev-parse HEAD` with the remote branch. Unpushed: the `ci` gate says "ship
first". Pushed: the `ci` gate says no pipeline ran for that sha.

### Gate clarify: which forge?

The origin host is neither GitLab nor GitHub. Ask which forge it is,
quoting `git remote get-url origin` as the context.

### Triage with the domain's rules (stage)

The domain rules below say how to read this red: REAL or INFRA, whether the
failure is this branch's or inherited, which jobs block. Where they run
`ci-triage.sh`, pass `--pipeline <N>`, the number `N` in `ci_watch`'s
`pipeline.id` (`gitlab:pipeline:N`), never `--ref` (the newest pipeline for
the ref, not the pushed sha). The box classifies and nothing else: no
claim, no watch, no retry, no push inside it.

### Read the triage report (stage)

`ci-triage.sh --pipeline <N>` prints one verdict per blocking failure (REAL
or INFRA) with its job id. `<N>` is the number in `ci_watch`'s
`pipeline.id` on GitLab, and the run id from the failing check's link on
GitHub. A script that fails instead of reporting: quote its output and
classify from `failedJobs` as the unbound flow does. INFRA job ids go to
`mr_retry` (GitLab) or `gh run rerun` (GitHub); the adapter's printed retry
command is not run.

### Classify each failing check REAL or INFRA

Read the failing checks' logs from the links `gh pr checks <mr>` prints,
then classify as for GitLab: REAL goes to the gate, INFRA gets one retry.

### Classify each failure REAL or INFRA

Read each failed job's `traceTail` in `ci_watch`'s `failedJobs` first;
`mr_job_trace` is for a tail too short to classify. REAL: the change broke
it (a test, type or lint failure in touched code). INFRA: unrelated to the
change (a runner, network or dependency outage, a known flake). One retry
per INFRA job; a REAL failure goes to the gate.

## The attendant lease

Exactly one actor attends an MR's CI at a time: this stage, a standalone
watch-ci session, or the board's doctor. The `ci_lease_*` tools own the
lease; the owner is this session, so any other fresh lease (a doctor or
another watch-ci session) refuses the claim. `ci_watch` heartbeats on every
poll and returns `lease_lost` the moment someone else holds the MR; the
GitHub poll heartbeats with `ci_lease_heartbeat`. A lease with no heartbeat
goes stale after 10 minutes (`ttlSeconds` 600) and may then be taken over.
A crashed session needs no cleanup.

Release it with `ci_lease_release` on every exit that leaves the MR
unattended (a written `ci`, Hold, Go back, Abandon, a failure); with `mr`
unset nothing was claimed. Fix and re-push keeps it, because the re-run
claims it again. The stand-down never touches it: that lease is someone
else's.

`Watch calls = 9` is 45 minutes of 300 second `ci_watch` calls; it resets
when the pushed sha changes and after a job retry. When a result carries
`priorPipelineId`, pass that value on the next call.

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The doctor's on it, but I can fix it faster" | Two actors pushing to one branch race each other's work. Stand down. |
| "I'll just retry the flaky job while the doctor works" | A retry is a repair action. The lease holder does it, not you. |
| "The claim tool errored, so I'll run the attendant script" | The script is retired. Fix the input once, then the off-script gate. |
| "ci_watch errored, so I'll poll with the GitLab CLI or a watch script" | Fix the input once, then the off-script gate. The STOP on `ci_watch state?` names it. |
| "The pipeline says success, that's green" | `ci_watch` only reports a pipeline for the pushed sha. A green read any other way is not the verdict. |

## Gate `ci` (red, timeout, or no pipeline)

Scope `ci:watch-ci:<attempt>`. One sentence above the form: the verdict
and a one-line triage per blocking failure.

| Question | Options (recommended first) | Shown when |
|---|---|---|
| `action` | **Fix and re-push** (a REAL failure in your change; from the third one in a run, **Hand back** is recommended instead) / **Retry the job** (a flake not yet retried) / **Hand back** (leave it red for the human) / **Abandon the run** | always |
| `next` | **Proceed** / **Iterate here** / **Go back to `<stage>`** / **Hold** | always |

Selection: `{"next":"fix|retry|handback|abandon|iterate|redirect|hold","to":"<stage or null>","note":"<their words or null>"}`.
Retry: `mr_retry` per INFRA job id on GitLab, `gh run rerun <run-id>
--failed` on GitHub (the run id from the failed check's link in `gh pr
checks <mr>`), after the re-claim.

## Gate `mark-ready` (green, `mr` set, still a draft)

One sentence above the form: CI is green for the MR's head, and whether
`evidence` is set.

| Question | Options (recommended first) | Shown when |
|---|---|---|
| `ready` | **Mark ready now** (when `evidence` is set and not `-`) / **Keep it draft** | always |
| `next` | **Proceed** / **Iterate here** / **Go back** / **Hold** | always |
| `to` | one option per earlier stage, split `to-1`, ... over 4 | Go back answered and more than one earlier stage row |

Selection: `{"ready":true|false,"next":"proceed|iterate|redirect|hold","to":"<stage or null>","note":"<their words or null>"}`.

## Domain rules

If a rule below asks for a move this graph marks STOP, take the off-script edge instead.

The domain supplies triage: how to read a red, REAL or INFRA, ownership,
noise. It never watches, claims, releases or pushes; the graph does.

The slot contract stays `watch-ci-domain@1`. A fill written for the
script-based engine still compiles: its text may name `ci-attendant.sh` and
`ci-watch.sh`, which this skill no longer vendors, and may triage with
`--ref`. The STOPs on `claim result?` and `ci_watch state?` redirect those
moves to `ci_lease_claim` and `ci_watch`; triage with `--pipeline <N>`.

{{slot:domain}}

When nothing is inlined above, the graph's other flows apply.
