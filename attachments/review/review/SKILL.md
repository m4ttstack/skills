# review

The standalone entry for reviewing someone else's change.

## Run

Outside a pipeline this verb is its own run, so the console shows it and
the Stop hook covers its pane. Skip this section when `RT_RUN_DB` is set
and `rt runs snapshot` shows `run.status` = `running`: you were invoked
from inside that run, you inherit it, `run.current_stage` is your stage,
and you close nothing at the end.

Otherwise, when a surface launched this pane (the `--spawned-by` case
below), start fresh: another pane's live run is not yours to resume.
Launched by hand, first the Resume offer: run `rt runs --repo <repo>
--json` (the `--repo` value in the flags block below) and keep the runs
whose `status` is `running` and `work_type` is `review`; never read the
run dbs by hand. Any found: gate
`clarify`, one sentence naming each candidate's `spawned_by`, `started_at`,
and `current_stage`, then the structured-question tool with one **Resume**
option per candidate (recommended for a run this session started earlier; a
run another live pane owns is not yours) / **Start fresh**; **Hold**.
Resume: `export RT_RUN_DB=~/.mattstack/runs/<repo>/<its id>/state.db`
(the candidate row's `id`), then `rt runs stage-start --stage
review` (a new attempt, which re-records this session) and `rt runs field set
hold - --stage review`; re-enter with the snapshot's decisions and do not
re-ask a question it already answered. rt runs verbs resolve your run
automatically (env RT_RUN_DB first, else the run this session started,
else the newest running run in this worktree; ambiguity errors loudly).
Export RT_RUN_DB only to drive a different run than yours.

Fresh. The flags for this verb, rendered by the compiler:

{{run-start.flags:review}}

```bash
PACK_DIRS="$(cd "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../.." && pwd -P)"
rt runs run-start <the flags above> --pack-dirs "$PACK_DIRS" [--spawned-by "<surface>"]
export RT_RUN_DB=<runDb from the response>
rt runs stage-start --stage review
```

The response must parse as JSON with `ok: true` and a `runDb`; anything
else means this rt predates the run verbs: stop and tell the user to
update rt. Pass `--spawned-by` when a board or another surface launched
this pane.

Every gate in this verb then writes its `gate` field and its decision with
`--stage review`. The close, after the final gate's answer and only when
this section ran `run-start`: `rt runs stage-done --stage review`, `rt runs
run-status --status done` (or `abandoned` when the gate said so), then
`unset RT_RUN_DB`.

{{include:run-identity}}

## 1. Resolve the target

From the conversation: an MR/PR URL, a bare !iid or #number, a ticket id,
or a branch name. Resolve to one MR/PR via the forge CLI
(`glab mr view <ref>` or `gh pr view <ref>`); ambiguity is gate `clarify`:
one sentence naming the candidates, then the structured-question tool
with one option per candidate and **Hold** (`rt runs field set gate clarify --stage
<stage>` before, where `<stage>` is `review` for an own run and
`run.current_stage` when inherited, and `rt runs decision record --contract gate@1 --scope
clarify --selection '{"target":"<picked>"}' --decided-by review` after).
Never a guess.

When the run is yours, record the resolved target per Run identity above:
`mr` (the MR/PR URL), `branch` (its source branch), `ticket` (the id the
MR itself names in branch, title, or description, when one exists).

## 2. Review

Fetch the diff (`glab mr diff` / `gh pr diff`). Then follow the review flow
below for depth triage, fresh-context reviewer dispatch, and the structured
draft. Its Criteria section carries the domain's review standards when the
pack binds them; apply its triage lines and addendum exactly as it directs.

## 3. Deliver

Present the draft, then state the severity levels present in one structured
line -- for example "Findings: Critical (2), Important (1); 3 findings." --
skipping any level with no findings. The counts are the draft's own,
before any selection narrows what posts.

Decision intake: when the caller hands this step a decided selection (a
board wrapper, or any @2 caller, handing `{findings, outcome}` down through
the fill -- findings naming the finding ids from the report json, outcome
naming the disposition), use it and ask nothing. Otherwise (a direct
terminal run) ask ONE gate with the runtime's structured-question tool,
these questions, each its own question (never fold one list into another
-- a question over 4 options sends the whole gate to the wait queue):

- `tiers`: a multi-select over the levels present, every level with
  findings pre-selected -- a terminal run has no per-finding UI, so this
  question stays tier-shaped and its answer becomes ids below
- `disposition`: single-select, Comment pre-selected; the offered set is
  forge-conditional -- Request changes only where the target forge's CLI
  supports it, `gh` does, `glab` does not; verify before offering, don't
  assume from memory
- `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** (their text changes
  the draft; re-present it and ask again) / **Hold**

The old two-gate protocol -- `post-severity` then `post-disposition` as
two sequential structured questions -- retires: nothing here presents two
gates in a row.

When this step asks its own question, bracket it the way every gate does:
`rt runs field set gate post --stage <stage>` before the question. Skip
that write when the caller already handed the decision -- nothing is
pending in that case.

Execute posting per review-posting (below), handing it the decided
selection as `{findings: <ids>, disposition: <outcome>}`. A terminal run's
`tiers` answer becomes those ids first: take every finding whose `tier` the
answer named from the report json, in report order. A caller that hands a
tier-shaped selection (an unmigrated wrapper), or a `tiers` answer with no
report json to map through, passes to posting as legacy `{levels: <tiers>,
disposition: <outcome>}`, which posting accepts unchanged; the record below
then carries that same legacy selection.

Then, when an rt-runs run is active, record the decision at execution time,
after posting: `rt runs decision record --contract gate@1 --scope post
--selection '{"findings":["f1","f3"],"disposition":"comment"}'
--decided-by <decider>`, where `<decider>` names the surface that
actually answered -- `board`, `console`, `pane`, or `shepherd`. Use the
decider the caller names alongside its handed selection; when this step
asked its own question, `<decider>` is `pane`. This replaces the old
`post-severity` + `post-disposition` record pair with one record at
scope `post`.

Post using the forge's thread mechanics: on GitHub use `gh pr review` / `gh
pr comment`; on GitLab follow the thread mechanics below.

Review verbs produce judgment and execute posting; they never decide what
posts.

Close, only when `## Run` started this run: `rt runs stage-done --stage
review`, `rt runs run-status --status done`, `unset RT_RUN_DB`. The final
message still ends with the target's link (the close HARD-GATE below).

## Wrap-up form contract

{{include:wrap-up-form}}

{{include:review-posting}}

Posting mechanics: a positioned inline comment is the `mr_comment_inline`
tool and a thread reply is `mr_reply_thread`; the daemon verifies
DiffNote placement and, on the silent general-note degrade, retries ONCE
with fresh diff_refs (deleting the stray notes; it cannot fix a position
GitLab rejects outright), so never hand-build a `glab api` position
payload.
