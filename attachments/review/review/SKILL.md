# review

The standalone entry for reviewing someone else's change. The graph below
is the run: follow its edges, and treat a move it does not show as a
question for a gate, never as a judgment call.

## Run

Outside a pipeline this verb is its own run, so the console shows it and
the Stop hook covers its pane. A caller that hands you a `runDb` (a
pipeline invoking this verb carries it in context) whose `run_snapshot`
shows `run.status` = `running` owns the run: you inherit it,
`run.current_stage` is your stage, and you pass that handed `runDb` on
every `run_*` call. Otherwise the graph starts or resumes a run of your
own, and your stage is `review`.

`run_list` takes `repo`, the `--repo` value in the flags block below, and
you keep the rows whose `status` is `running` and `work_type` is `review`.
Never read the run dbs by hand. `run_start` takes `flags` (this verb's
value in the block below, verbatim), `skillDir` (this skill's own
directory) and `spawnedBy` when a board or another surface launched this
pane.

{{run-start.flags:review}}

Keep `runDb` and pass it to every `run_*` call; nothing is exported. Every
gate in this verb writes its `gate` field with `stage: <stage>` and its
decision.

### Gate review clarify: Resume / Start fresh / Hold

No run of yours exists yet, so this gate is the structured-question tool
in the pane. One sentence naming each candidate's `spawned_by`,
`started_at` and `current_stage`, then one **Resume** option per candidate
(recommended for a run this session started earlier; a run another live
pane owns is not yours), **Start fresh**, **Hold**. A surface-launched pane
never reaches this gate: another pane's live run is not yours to resume.
Resume: your `runDb` is `<home>/.mattstack/runs/<repo>/<its id>/state.db`
(the candidate row's `id`, the home directory written out, never `~`).
Re-enter with the snapshot's decisions: a question they already answered
is never asked again. Hold here records nothing and ends the turn: no run
exists yet, so there is nothing to write a hold reason into.

### Resolve the review target

From the conversation: an MR/PR URL, a bare `!iid` or `#number`, a ticket
id, or a branch name. On GitLab `mr_view` takes `mrUrl` when you were
given a URL, else `repoName` = the checkout path plus `iid`; its
`maxAgeMs: 5000` makes the read live. A ticket id with no URL, iid or
branch, or more than one candidate, is the clarify gate. A lookup that
comes back empty means rt's open-MR cache does not hold the MR (outside its
author or time window): say so, and hold with that message as the reason
(`decidedBy: "pane"`). Never a guess. On a resume in a new session the
target is not in the conversation: the resumed snapshot's `mr` field is
the target.

### Gate review clarify: which target?

Bracket with `run_field_set {key: gate, value: clarify, stage: <stage>}`,
one sentence naming the candidates, then run gate-protocol's Runs
integration with kind `clarify` and two questions: `target`, one option
per candidate, and `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Hold**. Record
`run_decision {contract: gate@1, scope: clarify, selection: {"target":
"<picked>"}, decidedBy: <the answer's by>}`.

### Record the review target: mr, branch and any ticket

Up to three `run_field_set` calls, `stage: review`: `key: mr`, value the
MR or PR URL; `key: branch`, value its source branch; and, only when the
MR or PR itself names a ticket, `key: ticket`, value that id. Never guess
a ticket id the target does not carry.

### Print the review depth block

The review flow's "Commit to a review depth" below is this step, and its
HARD-GATE holds: the REVIEW DEPTH and EVIDENCE CHECK block, plus the
provider triage lines when Criteria is bound, prints before a test runs, a
checkout is touched, or the diff is read. Size the change from what
resolving it returned (title, description, changed files).

### MR-head checkout in hand for the review checks?

In hand means a checkout already at the MR head: one a caller handed, or
this pane's own tree when it sits at the MR head. At `read` depth nothing
runs, so take the yes edge. At `verify` or `repro` depth with none in
hand, provision one with `worktree_provision` (`repoName` = this
checkout's path, `branch` = the MR's or PR's source branch) and run every
check in the path it returns; never change this pane's own directory for
it. The tree keeps rt's default disposal, so rt disposes it once the MR
merges; the review never disposes it by hand. A refusal is quoted in the
setup observations, and the setup checks and the verify step's command
check are noted as not run.

### Review head worktree_provision returned a path?

A `branch-attached:<tree>` refusal names an existing tree; take the yes
edge with that tree's path, so the head check decides whether it is
usable.

### Provisioned review tree at the fetched head?

Compare `git rev-parse HEAD` run in that path with the fetched head
(`origin/mr-<iid>`, or `origin/pr-<n>` on GitHub). On a mismatch the tree
is not in hand: quote both shas, and note the setup checks and the verify
step's command check as not run. Never reset or pull that tree.

### Set up for the review depth

The review flow's "Set up for the depth". The GitLab fetch and diff above
are two separate commands, `targetBranch` from the live `mr_view`. Run
the checks the depth names in the MR-head checkout (the one in hand or
the one provisioned). Record every command and its result.

### Dispatch the fresh reviewer; it forms the findings

The review flow's "Dispatch the review", reviewer shape, with the full
payload. The findings form in that fresh context, never here.

### Assemble the review draft

The review flow's "Assemble the draft": Strengths / Issues (Critical /
Important / Minor, each `file:line`, what, why, fix) / Assessment. On a
second round, keep the round-one findings that verified and take the
re-dispatch's answer for the rest.

### Verify each blocking finding against the MR head

Blocking means Critical and Important; Minor findings are not verified.
Check each blocking finding's facts, never its reasoning:

- **Anchor:** the file exists at the head sha and the cited line is
  non-blank there, read with `git show <head>:<file>` (`origin/mr-<iid>`,
  or `origin/pr-<n>` on GitHub). A change can break an unchanged line, so
  the line need not be in the diff. A finding with no `file` anchor is
  checked on its quote and command only.
- **Quote:** code the finding quotes appears at or near that line.
- **Command:** a command the finding names (a test, a script) re-runs only
  in the MR-head checkout (in hand or provisioned); with none, skip it and
  note it; at `read` depth note "not run at read depth". A command that
  passes where the finding says it fails is a failed check.

A round counts each time this step runs, whether the first pass or a
re-dispatch.

### Re-dispatch a fresh reviewer on the unverified findings

One fresh-context dispatch, same template, naming each failed check
verbatim ("validate.ts:42 is a blank line on the head"; "the 'rounds half
up' test passes on the head") and asking it to confirm each finding with a
corrected anchor or withdraw it. The counter is verify rounds in this run.

### Demote each unverified finding to Minor, marked unverified

Move each finding that failed round two to Minor in the draft, its `body`
prefixed `Unverified: <the failed check>.` The Assessment's readiness is
never raised by a demotion (the reviewer may have had other reasons); its
reasoning gains one sentence naming the demoted findings. The json
sibling, written afterward, mirrors this demoted draft; demotion never
edits an already-written json on its own.

### Write the review report and its json sibling

The review flow's "Structured findings file", written after verification
so the json mirrors the verified draft.

### Write review-post.extras.json

Make one scratch directory (`mktemp -d`) and write its path out literally
from then on: each tool call is a fresh shell. Write
`<dir>/review-post.extras.json`:

```json
{"target": "!87", "reviewer": "<the reviewer the caller names>", "round": 2,
 "questions": [
   {"id": "outcome", "label": "Verdict on !87: <readiness clause>", "multi": false,
    "options": [{"value": "comment", "label": "comment (recommended)", "description": "<what picking it does for this review>"},
                {"value": "approve", "label": "approve", "description": "<what picking it does for this review>"}]},
   {"id": "next", "label": "Next", "multi": false,
    "options": [{"value": "proceed", "label": "proceed (recommended)"}, "iterate", "hold"]}
 ]}
```

| Field | Filled from |
|---|---|
| `target` | the MR/PR reference as its forge writes it: `!<iid>` or `#<number>` |
| `reviewer`, `round` | only when the caller supplies them; otherwise omit the key |
| `outcome` label | `Verdict on <target>: ` plus a clause composed from the json's `summary`, never either field verbatim: readiness `yes` reads "ready to merge"; `with-fixes` or `no` reads "not ready" or "ready once <the gist of the reasoning>" |
| `outcome` options | `comment` and `approve`, each described by what picking it does for this review. `request_changes` joins them only when this verb runs the gate itself and the target is on GitHub (`gh pr review --request-changes`); rt's GitLab MR tools have no Request changes. The recommendation goes FIRST, its label ending ` (recommended)`: `approve` when readiness is `yes`, else `comment` |
| `next` | only when this verb runs the gate itself; a caller that owns the gates navigates on its own, so omit the question |

Then the two scripts, exactly:

```bash
sh "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/review-source.sh" <report json> <dir>/review-post.extras.json > <dir>/review-post.source.json
sh "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/gate-ctx.sh" fit < <dir>/review-post.source.json > <dir>/review-post.open.json
```

`review-source.sh` turns every finding into a `findings-<n>` option (tier
order, four per question) whose label and description are the recipe
older board renderers parse, and gives each question its findings in full
as context. The output file IS the open: its `.context` and `.questions`
go to the gate verbatim, fitted to the shared budget. A report json from
before version 2 carries no bodies, so fit opens it as prose on its own;
that is correct, not an error. Never hand-edit the open, and never shorten
a body to make it fit. Any non-zero exit, 1 or 2, from either script is a
refusal at "Both review scripts exit 0?".

### Fix the field the review script names

Exit 1 from either script names the field to fix: in the extras, or in
the report json where it drifted from the draft. Fix exactly that, once.

### Hand back the severity line and the open's paths

A caller that owns the gates (a board wrapper; it says so when it
delegates) gets no gate from this verb. Hand back the severity line and
the absolute paths of `<dir>/review-post.open.json` (its source sits
beside it as `review-post.source.json`) and of the `gate-ctx.sh` that
fitted it, then wait for its `{findings, outcome}` or its hold.
`"fits": false` means even the prose is over the shared budget, and the
caller has no daemon to drop contexts for it: drop whole question contexts
largest first yourself and say so in the hand-back.

### Gate review-post: open the posting gate from review-post.open.json

Bracket with `run_field_set {key: gate, value: post, stage: <stage>}`.
Read `<dir>/review-post.open.json` with the Read tool and run
gate-protocol's Runs integration with its `questions`, `kind:
review-post` (the registry kind every review surface routes on; the run
field and the decision keep scope `post`) and its `context`. With
`"fits": false` open the file verbatim anyway: the daemon drops contexts
loudly. On the in-pane form (gate-protocol's `presentation: "form"`
branch) the form never shows the JSON: run `sh
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/gate-ctx.sh" prose <
<dir>/review-post.source.json`, show its `.context` in the pane before the
first form call, and make each `findings-<n>` question's form text its
label, a newline, then its prose `context`; options keep the gate's
labels and descriptions. Ask in gate order, up to four questions per call,
then submit exactly ONE `gate_answer` carrying every question. The gate
protocol records nothing for this gate: the `run_decision` node after
posting is its record.

### Gate review-post, legacy: tiers, outcome and next

No report json leaves nothing to build from. The same bracket and
`kind: review-post`, `context` the severity line verbatim, and three
questions: `tiers` (multi-select over the levels present, each
pre-selected), then `outcome` and `next` exactly as in the extras above.

### Take the human's changes into the review draft

Their text is changes to the draft: apply them. Their words asking for a
different review depth (verify instead of read, repro instead of verify,
or similarly) are a depth request: it sends the graph back to the depth
block and resets the verify-round counter, since a deeper depth means new
setup and a fresh verify pass. Anything else is a draft edit only:
re-present, and the next gate is a NEW gate, never the old one reopened.

### Make the recorded summary move once

Exactly the move the off-script gate recorded for the refused summary,
once.

### Make the recorded approval move once

Exactly the move the off-script gate recorded for the refused approval,
once.

### End with the review target's forge link

The final message ends with the target's id as a markdown link to its
real web URL: the one a posting tool returned, else `mr_view`'s `webUrl`
(or `gh pr view`'s url), else on a resume the snapshot's `mr` field (the
review-posting close HARD-GATE below).

### Open the review off-script gate: a review script refused twice

The proposed move is the legacy gate in place of the structured open.
The rest is the shape in Review off-script gates below.

### Open the review off-script gate: gh pr review refused

The proposed move: post the summary body as a plain PR comment with `gh
pr comment <ref>`, and leave the disposition to the human.

### Open the review off-script gate: mr_comment_inline refused

The daemon already verified placement and retried once, so a refusal
here is final for this position. The proposed move is to post the finding
in the summary comment instead, as if it had no `file` anchor, so the
summary posts resolvable.

### Open the review off-script gate: mr_comment summary refused

The inline threads are already posted: `context` lists them. The proposed
move: the human posts the summary body (quoted in full in `context`) in
the forge UI, and the run records it as posted by the human.

### Open the review off-script gate: mr_approve refused

The findings and the summary are posted; only the approval failed. The
proposed move: the human approves in the forge UI, and the run records
the approval as theirs.

## Review off-script gates

Leaving the graph is legal when it is explicit. Every off-script box opens
a gate per the gate protocol, scope `off-script:review:<n>` (`n` counts
from 1 in this run), `context` quoting the refusal verbatim:

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| `action` | **Take the proposed move** (the value spells the move in full) / **Hand back** |
| `next` | **Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Hold** |

Selection: `{"move": "<the move>", "why": "<the refusal>", "action":
"take|handback", "next": "proceed|iterate|hold", "note": "<their words or
null>"}`. `action: handback` is hand back, whatever `next` says; otherwise
`next: iterate` is iterate here, `next: hold` is hold, and `next: proceed`
is take. Take makes exactly that move, once, then continues after it.
Iterate here retries the refused call with their note; each retry that
fails opens a new gate. A hold's reason, like a hand-back's, names every
thread and note already posted. A gate that comes back `closed` is a
hold whose reason is "gate closed"; record it as any hold and end the
turn.

## What the graph cannot show

- Review verbs produce judgment and execute posting; they never decide
  what posts.
- The draft is presented once: after verify and any demotion, never
  before. Present it, then state the severity levels present in one
  structured line, for example "Findings: Critical (2), Important (1); 3
  findings.", skipping any level with no findings. The counts are the
  demoted draft's own, before any selection narrows what posts.
- A caller's decided selection is `{findings, outcome}` (findings naming
  finding ids from the report json, outcome the disposition), or from an
  unmigrated caller the legacy `{tiers, outcome}`. Use the decider the
  caller names alongside it.
- Posting runs per review-posting below, handed `{findings: <ids>,
  disposition: <outcome>}`: `<ids>` is the union of every `findings-<n>`
  answer (unwrap a `{value, note}` object to its value), empty when the
  gate carried none, and `<outcome>` the answered value, already in
  posting's vocabulary (`comment`, `approve`, `request_changes`). A
  tier-shaped selection, or a `tiers` answer, passes as legacy `{levels:
  <tiers>, disposition: <outcome>}`, which posting accepts unchanged.
- The post record's `selection` is that same object (for example
  `{"findings": ["f1", "f3"], "disposition": "comment"}`); `decidedBy`
  names the surface that actually answered (`board`, `console`, `pane`, or
  `shepherd`): the caller's named decider on intake, else the gate
  answer's `by`.
- A hold records `run_decision {contract: gate@1, scope:
  hold:<stage>:<attempt>, selection: {"reason": "<their words>"},
  decidedBy: <the answer's by>}` and `run_field_set {key: hold, value:
  "<their words>", stage: <stage>}`, then ends the turn.
- On a resume, a thread or note that the latest hold's reason names as
  already posted is never posted again; its finding is skipped at
  posting.
- A gate that comes back `closed` is a hold whose reason is "gate
  closed"; record it as any hold and end the turn.
- A fetch, diff or `gh pr diff` that errors is a hold whose reason quotes
  the error.

Posting mechanics on GitLab: a positioned inline comment is the
`mr_comment_inline` tool, a thread reply is `mr_reply_thread`, the summary
is ONE `mr_comment`, and the Approve disposition is `mr_approve` once the
findings have posted. The summary posts resolvable (the default) when its
issue list carries a selected finding with no `file` anchor, and with
`resolvable: false` when it carries none. The daemon verifies DiffNote
placement and, on the silent general-note degrade, retries ONCE with fresh
diff_refs (deleting the stray notes; it cannot fix a position GitLab
rejects outright), so never hand-build a position payload.
`mr_comment` returns `mrUrl`, the link the close needs. On GitHub use `gh
pr review` / `gh pr comment`: GitHub has no inline mechanism, so every
selected finding, anchored or not, rides in the one `gh pr review` body,
with its `file:line` in the text.
