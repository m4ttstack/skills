# Self-review (your own branch)

Reviewing the change you just made, at any checkpoint between tasks or right
before shipping. This is the self-facing caller of the review flow inlined
below: point the engine at the current branch, then act on the draft it
returns. The graph below is the run: follow its edges, and treat a move it
does not show as a question for a gate, never as a judgment call.

## Run

Outside a pipeline this verb is its own run, so the console shows it and
the Stop hook covers its pane. A caller that hands you a `runDb` whose
`run_snapshot` shows `run.status` = `running` owns the run: you inherit
it, `run.current_stage` is your stage, and you pass that handed `runDb`
on every `run_*` call. Otherwise the graph starts or resumes a run of your
own, and your stage is `self-review`.

`run_list` takes `repo`, the `--repo` value in the flags block below, and
you keep the rows whose `status` is `running` and `work_type` is
`self-review`. Never read the run dbs by hand. `run_start` takes `flags`
(this verb's value in the block below, verbatim), `skillDir` (this skill's
own directory) and `spawnedBy` when a board or another surface launched
this pane.

{{run-start.flags:self-review}}

Keep `runDb` and pass it to every `run_*` call; nothing is exported. Every
gate in this verb writes its `gate` field with `stage: <stage>` and its
decision.

Whoever wrote the code re-derives the same assumptions while reading it back
and nods at them; a bug on the page reads as the intent that produced it. The
judgment does not happen here -- it happens in the fresh context that
the review flow dispatches.

<HARD-GATE>
Do not form the code-quality judgment yourself -- not even a careful first
pass meant to be backed up by a fresh review later. The fresh-context
reviewer is the PRIMARY reviewer, not an optional escalation, and this skill
owns dispatching it (via the review flow below) rather than suggesting the
developer get a review elsewhere. Objective checks (tests, type checks,
linters) are fine and expected -- authorship does not bias a compiler.
Reading the diff and deciding whether it is "solid" is not; that is the
reviewer's job.

A request to skip the dispatch -- "don't burn tokens on subagents," a late
hour, a partner who just wants a gut check -- does not waive this gate; the
gate outranks it. The fresh review is one dispatch, not a proliferation of
subagents; skipping it does not save the partner's time, it moves the cost
downstream to production. Diligence performed inside the biased context is
still the biased context, so checking carefully before the inline verdict
does not launder it into independence. And a plausible issue turned up
inline is evidence of what surfaced, not of what a fresh, unbiased read would
catch that this one missed.
</HARD-GATE>

### Gate self-review clarify: Resume / Start fresh / Hold

No run of yours exists yet, so this gate is the structured-question tool
in the pane. One sentence naming each candidate's `spawned_by`,
`started_at` and `current_stage`, then one **Resume** option per candidate
(recommended for a run this session started earlier; a run another live
pane owns is not yours), **Start fresh**, **Hold**. A surface-launched pane
never reaches this gate: another pane's live run is not yours to resume.
Resume: your `runDb` is `<home>/.mattstack/runs/<repo>/<its id>/state.db`
(the candidate row's `id`, the home directory written out, never `~`). Hold
here records nothing (no run has started or been resumed to record it
against) and ends the turn.

### Find the self-review merge-base

Run `git merge-base origin/HEAD HEAD`; when `origin/HEAD` is unset, use the
default branch by name instead. The diff runs from that base through the
working tree, uncommitted changes included.

### Record the self-review branch and any ticket

`run_field_set {key: branch, value: <branch>, stage: self-review}`, and
`run_field_set {key: ticket, value: <ticket>, stage: self-review}` only when
the branch names one; never guess a ticket.

### Gate self-review clarify: which requirements source?

The branch carries no ticket and the session holds no task text: never
review against nothing. Bracket with `run_field_set {key: gate, value:
clarify, stage: <stage>}`, say in one sentence what is missing, then run
gate-protocol's Runs integration with kind `clarify` and two questions:
`source`, the candidate sources (the task as stated, a linked doc, or
their text), and `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Hold**. Record
`run_decision {contract: gate@1, scope: clarify, selection: {"source":
"<picked>"}, decidedBy: <the answer's by>}`.

### Print the self-review depth block

The review flow's "Commit to a review depth" below is this step: the
REVIEW DEPTH and EVIDENCE CHECK block, plus the provider triage lines when
Criteria is bound, printed before any check runs. You are already in the
worktree, so `verify` and `repro` need no provisioning.

### Run the checks the self-review depth names

The review flow's "Set up for the depth": the tests, type checks and
linters the depth names, in this worktree. Record each command and its
result; they travel to the reviewer as setup observations.

### Dispatch the fresh reviewer on your own diff

Review the work as it stands now, on the diff the merge-base step found.
Hand the review flow's "Dispatch the review" the diff, the requirements,
and a label (the branch or task name). One dispatch, never skipped,
however small the change.

### Open the self-review off-script gate: a fill asks for a move this graph forbids

A rule under Criteria or Reviewer below asks for a move the graph marks
STOP (an inline verdict in place of the dispatch, say). Open a gate per the
gate protocol, scope `off-script:self-review:<n>` (`n` counts from 1 in
this run), `context` quoting the rule. Questions: `action` (**Take the
proposed move**, the value spelling the move in full / **Hand back**) and
`next` (**Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Hold**).
Selection: `{"move": "<the move>", "why": "<the rule>", "action":
"take|handback", "next": "proceed|iterate|hold", "note": "<their words or
null>"}`. `action: handback` is hand back whatever `next` says; otherwise
`next: iterate` is iterate here, `next: hold` is hold, and `next: proceed`
is take.

### Make the recorded self-review move once

Exactly the move the gate recorded, once; its result stands in for the
fresh reviewer's draft.

### Assemble the self-review draft

Strengths / Issues (Critical / Important / Minor) / Assessment, per the
review flow's "Assemble the draft". Present it; the draft is the sentence
and the gate that follows is the close.

### Gate self-review: fix and next, after the draft

Bracket with `run_field_set {key: gate, value: self-review, stage:
<stage>}`, then run gate-protocol's Runs integration with kind
`self-review` and these questions, each its own question (never fold one
list into another: a question over 4 options sends the whole gate to the
wait queue):

- `fix`: **Fix the blocking findings now** (recommended when any Critical
  or Important exists) / **Fix the minors too** / **Ship as is**
- `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Hold** /
  **Abandon**

Record `run_decision {contract: gate@1, scope: self-review, selection:
{"fix": "blocking|all|none", "note": "<their words or null>"}, decidedBy:
<the answer's by>}`. Blocking means Critical and Important; the minors
answer fixes every finding.

A resumed run whose snapshot records the latest `self-review` decision
carrying `fix` reuses that decision's `fix` answer, treats `next` as
proceed, and asks nothing here.

### Gate self-review again: quote the failing output

A new gate, never the old one reopened: the same bracket and kind
`self-review`, with `context` quoting the failing test output and naming
the finding. Questions, each its own: `finding`: **Try this finding
again** / **Leave it open and move on**; `next`: **Proceed** (recommended)
/ **Hold** / **Abandon**. `next: hold` is hold and `next: abandon` is
abandon whatever `finding` says; otherwise the `finding` answer decides.
Record `run_decision {contract: gate@1, scope: self-review, selection:
{"finding": "<its id or file:line>", "retry": true|false, "note": "<their
words or null>"}, decidedBy: <the answer's by>}`. Try again resets that
finding's attempt count to 0; each finding gets one reopened gate, after
which it is left open.

### Next selected finding to fix?

One finding at a time, in draft order: the next finding the fix answer
selected that is not yet fixed, recorded not reproduced, or left open.

### Is the finding testable?

A finding with behavior (a wrong value, a crash, a missing case) is
testable. Naming, docs and structure findings are not: fix them directly,
and the suite plus a re-read of the finding is their check.

### Write a failing test for the finding

The test states the finding's claim against the current code, before any
fix. Before the first fix attempt on this finding, save a patch of every
file the attempts will touch: a copy in a scratch directory outside the
repo, so its own attempts can be undone.

### Record the finding as not reproduced; no fix

A test that passes before any fix means the claim did not hold on this
code. Make no fix; list the finding as not reproduced, with the test that
showed it, in what you hand back.

### Fix the finding and run the tests

The smallest fix, then the finding's test and the checks the depth ran.
The counter is attempts on this finding within this pass.

### Record the finding as left open

No more attempts on it in this run; keep its last failing output. It is
listed as left open, with that output, in the final message and any
hand-back. Undo only this finding's own fix attempts, from the patch
saved before the first attempt; never restore a file from HEAD or the
index, since the diff under review includes uncommitted work. Mark the
finding's failing test skipped, the finding id in its name or reason (or
remove it), and keep its last output for the final message, so the suite
is green before the next finding.

### Hand back with the Minor findings listed

Ship as is: hand back to the flow that called this verb with the Minor
findings listed for the record, plus any finding left open or not
reproduced. Every unfixed Critical or Important finding counts as left
open.

## What the graph cannot show

- Where the domain defines ship-time gates, this self-review complements
  them and never checks their box.
- A hold records `run_decision {contract: gate@1, scope:
  hold:<stage>:<attempt>, selection: {"reason": "<their words>"},
  decidedBy: <the answer's by>}` and `run_field_set {key: hold, value:
  "<their words>", stage: <stage>}`, then ends the turn.
- After fixes, the flow that called this verb continues (ship, or the
  next task); the close runs only after the fixes the gate selected are
  verified.
- Before the close, the final message lists every selected finding as
  fixed, not reproduced (with the test that showed it), or left open. On
  ship as is that list includes every Critical and Important finding,
  which stay open.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "For a change this small I'll just give my own read" | Small, own-authored changes are peak author bias, not an exemption. Dispatch the fresh reviewer. |
| "I'll do a first-pass read myself and a fresh review can back it up" | The fresh reviewer IS the review, not a backup for one already formed. Don't pre-empt it with an inline verdict. |
| "I'll suggest the developer get a review elsewhere" | This skill owns the dispatch; don't outsource it back to whoever is waiting. |
| "Re-reading my own lines is low-value, I'll just eyeball and ship" | Right that re-reading is low-value -- which is why a fresh context, not this eyeball, does the reading. |
| "I know what this does, I just wrote it" | That is the bias stated as a qualification. Dispatch the reviewer. |
