# checkout

Get a teammate's branch into a local worktree so you can read or test it --
this is a review checkout, not the start of your own work.

### Pick the branch from the result

The origin URL decides the forge host. Read the source branch from the
result. The GitLab tools and `worktree_provision` take `repoName` = the
current checkout's absolute path; `worktree_provision` takes `branch` = the picked branch (a given
branch name verbatim); `mr_view` takes `mrUrl` = the link, or `iid` = the
number. For a ticket id, keep the rows whose `sourceBranch`
(GitHub: head branch) or `title` carries the id. The GitLab tools read the
daemon's open-MR cache, which may not hold every MR: an empty GitLab
result means ask, not "none exists".

### Gate clarify: which branch

Scope `clarify`. One sentence naming the candidates, then the questions,
each its own question:

- `branch`: one option per candidate, or their text
- `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Hold**

Selection `{"branch":"<picked>"}`. Their text goes back to "What was
given?" and resolves again; the second text answer ends at **Unresolved:
reported**, naming what was tried.

Hold: when this conversation holds a run's `runDb`, record
`hold:<run.current_stage>:<attempt>` (`run_decision` with
`contract` `gate@1`, `scope` `hold:<run.current_stage>:<attempt>`,
`selection` `{"reason":"<their words>"}`, `decidedBy` `<the answer's
by>`), then `run_field_set` with `key` `hold`, `value` `<their words>`,
`stage` `<run.current_stage>`, and end the turn. With no run, Hold ends the
turn and makes no `run_*` call.

{{include:spawned-no-run-guard}}

Never a guess.

### Fix the named argument

Fix only the form of the argument the error names (for example a
`repoName` that is not an absolute path: pass the current checkout's
absolute path; or a malformed branch string), then call
`worktree_provision` once more. Never pick a different branch or repo, and
never start, restart or replace the daemon. A branch the error says does
not exist is not an argument error: like any other error the graph does not
name, it ends at **Provision refused: reported**, quoting the error. A
daemon that is down or a repo rt does not know goes to the off-script gate,
not here.

### Off-script gate

Scope `off-script:<run.current_stage>:<n>`, `n` counting from 1 per
off-script round in this run; with no run, per the gate steps. The
context sentence quotes the `worktree_provision` error. The
questions, each its own question:

- `action`: **Take the proposed move** (the value spells the move in full)
  / **Hand back**
- `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Hold**

Selection `{"move":"<the move>","why":"<the refusal>","action":"take|handback","next":"proceed|iterate|hold","note":"<their words or null>"}`.
Read `next` first: **Hold** ends the turn with no move made; **Iterate
here** means the human fixed the cause (started the daemon, registered the
repo) and wants `worktree_provision` retried, and it ignores `action`; only
**Proceed** applies `action` (take or hand back). The proposed
move is one plain-git worktree for the branch at a path the value names;
retrying the refused tool is **Iterate here**, never **Take**. A plain-git
worktree is a move only the human's **Take** can authorize; never make one
on any other answer. **Provision refused: reported** quotes the
`worktree_provision` error.

### Make the recorded move once

Exactly the move the selection recorded, once. The move must produce the
worktree path; an answer that only fixes the cause ("I started the daemon,
go ahead") is **Iterate here**, not **Take**. Its result decides the next
node: success goes to the report with the path it made; a failure is
reported, never a second off-script gate.

### Report the path and whose branch it is

Report the path (the `path` `worktree_provision` returned, the worktree
`git worktree list` already showed, or the one the recorded move made) and
that the branch is checked out there. State whose branch it is. Do not
enter the worktree, whatever the tool suggests: a review checkout leaves
the session where it is.

## Safety

- Never commit or push on the checked-out branch -- it belongs to someone
  else.
- State plainly whose branch this is when you report the result.

## Gates

Every gate box above runs this graph.

```dot
digraph gate_steps {
    rankdir=TB;

    "Trigger: a gate box in the graph above" [shape=ellipse];
    "This conversation holds a runDb?" [shape=diamond];
    "run_field_set {runDb, key: gate, value: <scope>, stage}" [shape=plaintext];
    "Publish and answer per the gate protocol" [shape=box];
    "run_decision {runDb, contract: gate@1, scope, selection, decidedBy}" [shape=plaintext];
    "Spawned pane?" [shape=diamond];
    "One error line to the spawning surface" [shape=box];
    "In-pane form only; nothing recorded" [shape=box];
    "Gate path ended" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Answer back at the gate box" [shape=doublecircle style=filled fillcolor=lightgreen];

    "Trigger: a gate box in the graph above" -> "This conversation holds a runDb?";
    "This conversation holds a runDb?" -> "run_field_set {runDb, key: gate, value: <scope>, stage}" [label="yes"];
    "This conversation holds a runDb?" -> "Spawned pane?" [label="no"];
    "run_field_set {runDb, key: gate, value: <scope>, stage}" -> "Publish and answer per the gate protocol";
    "Publish and answer per the gate protocol" -> "run_decision {runDb, contract: gate@1, scope, selection, decidedBy}";
    "run_decision {runDb, contract: gate@1, scope, selection, decidedBy}" -> "Answer back at the gate box";
    "Spawned pane?" -> "One error line to the spawning surface" [label="yes"];
    "Spawned pane?" -> "In-pane form only; nothing recorded" [label="no: a human invoked it"];
    "One error line to the spawning surface" -> "Gate path ended";
    "In-pane form only; nothing recorded" -> "Answer back at the gate box";
}
```

### Publish and answer per the gate protocol

If a rule below asks for a move this graph marks STOP, take the off-script edge instead.

{{include:gate-protocol}}

### One error line to the spawning surface

The guard text under **Gate clarify: which branch** says what the line is
and where it goes; the off-script gate sends the same line. The gate path
ends there.

### In-pane form only; nothing recorded

A human invocation with no run gets the same form in the pane, and no
`run_*` call is made.
