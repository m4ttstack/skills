# rebase-worktree

Bring one worktree's branch current with the default branch: the
`branch_sync` tool first, the manual rebase only where `branch_sync` did
not run. This never guesses: it refuses on a dirty tree, refuses a stack
member, and hands conflicts back to a human.

`<tree>` is the worktree's absolute path. The graph is the map; each box has a section below with the how. Every gate box runs the gate steps graph under **Gates**.

### Gate clarify: dirty tree

Scope `clarify`. One sentence listing the uncommitted paths, then the
questions `tree`: **I committed them, retry** / **Abort**; **Hold**.
Selection `{"tree":"retry|abort"}`. Never stash and proceed: moving
someone's uncommitted work is not this skill's call. The table under
**Gate push** binds this form too.

{{include:spawned-no-run-guard}}

### Discover the default from the forge

The origin URL names the forge. GitHub: `gh repo view --json
defaultBranchRef`. GitLab: `git -C <tree> remote set-head origin --auto`
(it sets the local ref and pushes nothing), then read the symbolic-ref
again. An MR's `targetBranch` is where that MR merges, not the default
branch: never take the default from it. Never hardcode a branch name.

### branch_sync result?

`branch_sync` does the fetch, the stack check, the rebase, and the push in
one call, and says why when it will not. The result decides, and nothing
else does:

| result | carries | next |
|---|---|---|
| `status: "synced"` | `divergedFromOrigin` (true when local and origin had diverged before the sync) | Synced: `branch_sync` rebased and pushed with force-with-lease, or found the branch current and pushed nothing. Go to **Report the move**; the push already happened, so no push gate. |
| `status: "conflict"` | rt sync's bundle (`unresolvedFiles`, `backupBranch`, `state: mid-rebase`) | The rebase is paused in the worktree. Go to **Conflict: caller composing per branch?** with `unresolvedFiles` as the files. |
| error `rt sync refused (exit 4): could not determine the default branch ...` or `rt sync refused (exit 4): could not list open MRs to rule out a stack: ...` | error text only | The stack could not be verified either way. Go to `git -C <tree> remote get-url origin` and the manual path's stack guards; if those fail for the same reason, stop at **Stack check could not run: reported** and report both failures. Never rebase an unverified branch. | <!-- mcp-lint: allow -->
| any other `rt sync refused (exit 4): ...` error: a stack refusal, whose text ends `Run: <tool>` (e.g. `<branch> is a member of stack <name> (parent <parent>); rebasing it alone onto <default> would break the stack. Run: <tool>`) | error text only | **Refused: stack member, tool named**: report the error text and name the tool after `Run:`. The run ends here; the restack belongs to the stack tool. | <!-- mcp-lint: allow -->
| error `rt sync timed out after ...`, `could not start rt sync`, or `rt sync refused (exit N): ...` with N other than 4 | error text only | rt sync itself failed. Report it, then go to `git -C <tree> remote get-url origin` (the manual path). | <!-- mcp-lint: allow -->
| any other error: `branch_sync` refused before rt sync ran (`refusing to sync <branch>: ...`, `refusing to reset <branch> to origin: ...`, `origin/<branch> has commits this tree lacks; ...`, `a rebase is in progress; ...`, or a git read that failed) | error text only | **Refused: reported**: report the error text and stop. The manual path's force-with-lease push would not protect what the tool refused over. When the text ends `run git_pull first`, go to **Pulled once already?** instead: one `git_pull {tree}`, then one more `branch_sync`. |

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The stack refusal came back, but I can see the MR targets the default branch, so I'll rebase by hand" | A stack refusal is the guard's verdict, not a hint. Only the two could-not-run texts open the manual path, and only through its own guards. |
| "`status: "synced"`, so now the push gate" | `branch_sync` already pushed; that is the fast path's contract. A push form for a push that happened is a false choice. Report it as pushed. |
| "The check could not run, so the safe move is to stop and ask" | The manual guards are the same check by other means. Run them; stop only when they fail too. |
| "It only said `refusing to sync`; the manual path will get it done" | A preflight refusal is a safety verdict on this tree. Report it and stop; the manual path is only for the rows that send there. |

### Apply the child and parent checks

A single-branch rebase is legal only when the branch is stack-free in both
directions. On GitLab both checks read the one `mr_list` result; on GitHub
they read the two `gh` results.

- **Child check:** the branch's open MR or PR (GitLab: the row whose
  `sourceBranch` is this branch, then its `targetBranch`; GitHub: `gh pr
  view <branch>`). Targets anything other than the default branch:
  REFUSE, naming the target. A stacked branch rebases onto
  `origin/<target>` if it rebases at all; moving it onto the default
  branch destroys the stack.
- **Parent check:** open MRs or PRs targeting this branch (GitLab: the
  rows whose `targetBranch` is this branch; GitHub: `gh pr list --base
  <branch>`). Any hit: REFUSE, naming the dependents. Rewriting a parent's
  history strands every child on commits that no longer exist.

When the result's `scope` limits the cache to certain authors or a time
window, the verdict covers only that scope: say so, and carry "stack check
covered <scope> only" on the old head -> new head line (**Report the
move**) so it reaches whoever gates the push.

Either refusal is a restack signal: the chain moves together or not at
all. Say so and point at the stack tool (`gitq:sync` where available);
never improvise a multi-branch rebase here.

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The pipeline needs the default branch's fix" | A stacked MR reaches the default branch through its stack root. Rebasing it there directly destroys the stack. |
| "Just this parent; the children catch up later" | The moment the parent rewrites, every child points at history that no longer exists. |
| "No open MR in either direction" | On a synced read (no `syncError`, `syncedAt` not 0), the branch is stack-free within the read's `scope`: proceed, naming any scope limit. |

### Gate conflict:rebase-worktree:<attempt>

One sentence listing the conflicted files (the bundle's `unresolvedFiles`,
the files `git_rebase` returned, or the `UU` and similar rows of
`git -C <tree> status --porcelain`). That sentence is also the hand-back
when a caller composes this per branch.

`<attempt>` counts from 1. The questions, each its own question (never
fold one list into another: a question over 4 options sends the whole gate
to the wait queue):

- `conflict`: **Leave the rebase in progress for me** (recommended) /
  **Abort the rebase**
- `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Hold**

Selection `{"next":"leave|abort|iterate|hold","note":"<their words or null>"}`.
**Iterate here** means the human worked in their own pane; the graph
re-reads the tree. Never resolve the conflict yourself, stage the files,
or continue or skip the rebase.

{{include:spawned-no-run-guard}}

### Report the move

Old head -> new head, from the two `git -C <tree> log -1 --oneline`
reads: the one before `branch_sync`, and the same read once the rebase
finished (the `HEAD` read already made it after an iterate). The line ends
"already current; nothing pushed" when the heads match, or "pushed by
branch_sync" when `branch_sync` moved it. Carry any "stack check covered
<scope> only" caveat on the line. When a caller composes this per branch,
this line is what goes back.

### Gate push

Scope `push`. The sentence is the old head -> new head line; nothing else
before the form. The questions, each its own question (never fold one list
into another: a question over 4 options sends the whole gate to the wait
queue):

- `push`: **Push with force-with-lease now** / **Leave it unpushed**
  (recommended when the branch has an open MR others may have pulled)
- `next`: **Proceed** / **Iterate here** / **Hold**

Selection `{"push":true|false,"next":"proceed|iterate|hold","note":"<their words or null>"}`.

{{include:spawned-no-run-guard}}

**These thoughts mean you are skipping the gate -- STOP:**

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Push with force-with-lease now is the natural next action, so I'll mark it Recommended" | Only **Leave it unpushed** carries a recommended label, and only conditionally (an open MR others may have pulled). Render that qualifier attached to that option exactly; never move it to the push option. |
| "Restating the finding and explaining each option makes the ask clearer" | A gate's form is one sentence of context, then the bare option labels the gate text names, nothing more -- no restated heading, no per-option description, no conditional aside on when Hold applies. |

### Off-script gate

Scope `off-script:<run.current_stage>:<n>`, `n` counting from 1 within
this attempt; with no run, the in-pane form per the gate steps. The
context sentence quotes the `git_push` refusal. The questions, each its
own question:

- `action`: **Take the proposed move** (the value spells the move in full)
  / **Hand back**
- `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Hold**

Selection `{"move":"<the move>","why":"<the refusal>","action":"take|handback","next":"proceed|iterate|hold","note":"<their words or null>"}`.
**Iterate here** means the human fixed the cause and wants the push
retried.

### Make the recorded move once

Exactly the move the selection recorded, once. Its result decides the next
node; a failure is reported, never a second off-script gate.

## What the graph cannot show

- The two "caller composing per branch?" diamonds are yes when the invoking verb said it composes this as its per-branch step (sync-open-mrs does).
- "Head still the old head?" yes means the human aborted in their pane, never "already current".
- A mechanical `git_push` refusal is one of "tree must be the absolute path of the root" (retry once with the printed root) or "not registered with rt" (no retry).
- Never push unasked.
- Aborting the rebase happens only on the **Abort the rebase** answer.
- "Upstream set?" is no when the `status -sb` branch line carries no `...origin/<branch>` tracking ref.

## Gates

Every gate box above runs this graph.

```dot
digraph gate_steps {
    rankdir=TB;

    "Trigger: a gate box in the graph above" [shape=ellipse];
    "This conversation holds a runDb?" [shape=diamond];
    "run_field_set {runDb, key: gate, value: <scope>, stage}" [shape=plaintext];
    "Publish and answer per the gate protocol" [shape=box];
    "run_decision {runDb, contract: gate@1, scope, selection, decidedBy}" [shape=plaintext];
    "Spawned pane?" [shape=diamond];
    "One error line to the spawning surface" [shape=box];
    "In-pane form only; nothing recorded" [shape=box];
    "Gate path ended" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Answer back at the gate box" [shape=doublecircle style=filled fillcolor=lightgreen];

    "Trigger: a gate box in the graph above" -> "This conversation holds a runDb?";
    "This conversation holds a runDb?" -> "run_field_set {runDb, key: gate, value: <scope>, stage}" [label="yes"];
    "This conversation holds a runDb?" -> "Spawned pane?" [label="no"];
    "run_field_set {runDb, key: gate, value: <scope>, stage}" -> "Publish and answer per the gate protocol";
    "Publish and answer per the gate protocol" -> "run_decision {runDb, contract: gate@1, scope, selection, decidedBy}";
    "run_decision {runDb, contract: gate@1, scope, selection, decidedBy}" -> "Answer back at the gate box";
    "Spawned pane?" -> "One error line to the spawning surface" [label="yes"];
    "Spawned pane?" -> "In-pane form only; nothing recorded" [label="no: a human invoked it"];
    "One error line to the spawning surface" -> "Gate path ended";
    "In-pane form only; nothing recorded" -> "Answer back at the gate box";
}
```

### Publish and answer per the gate protocol

If a rule below asks for a move this graph marks STOP, take the off-script edge instead.

{{include:gate-protocol}}

### One error line to the spawning surface

The guard text in the gate's own section (for the off-script gate, the
one under **Gate push**) says what the line is and where it goes; the gate
path ends there.

### In-pane form only; nothing recorded

A human invocation with no run gets the same form in the pane, and no
